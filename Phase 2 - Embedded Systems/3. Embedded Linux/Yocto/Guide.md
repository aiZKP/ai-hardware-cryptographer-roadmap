# Yocto Project — Embedded Linux Distribution Engineering

A structured course for hardware and software engineers who need to **build, own, and ship** a custom embedded Linux—not just install one. The goal is clarity first: you should finish with a **mental model** that survives release renames and new boards.

**Time investment (typical):** 4–10 weeks part-time for Modules 0–6; full course including production topics 3–6 months alongside real hardware.

**What you will be able to do**

- Explain how BitBake, recipes, layers, and images relate end-to-end.
- Reproduce a build from metadata alone (team-ready, not "works on my laptop").
- Add a package, patch a component, and ship a smaller, testable image.
- Debug failures using logs and task graphs instead of guessing.
- Know when Yocto is the right tool—and when Buildroot or a vendor BSP is faster.

Each module is a separate file under **[Lecture/](Lecture/README.md)** with labs and previous/next navigation. Work in order: [Lecture-01](Lecture/Lecture-01.md) through [Lecture-16](Lecture/Lecture-16.md).

All step-by-step content, labs, glossary, and external links live in the **[Lecture/](Lecture/README.md)** files above.

*Course maintainer tip:* when documentation and the internet disagree, trust the **docs matching your exact Yocto release branch**—metadata syntax and variable names do evolve.
