## 1. Get Poky (reference flow)

Exact branch names change; always prefer the **documentation for the release you chose**.

Typical sequence (conceptual): clone Poky at a named release branch; run the oe-init-build-env script for your build directory; set MACHINE to a reference machine (often QEMU for learning); build core-image-minimal first.

## 2. What success produces

You should be able to point to the **image artifacts** under the build directory deploy area (layout varies by version), and a **kernel** and **rootfs** suitable for the selected MACHINE.

## 3. Lab 3 — Minimal image, boot under QEMU (or hardware)

Build core-image-minimal for a QEMU-capable machine if your checkout supports it. Boot per the release docs. Log in and verify kernel and OS identity with standard shell commands.

**Done when:** you have repeated the build from a clean shell using only your notes (no random blog copy-paste).
