## 1. Linux does not want “an SPI Wi-Fi gadget”

Linux userspace tools do not know or care that your radio sits behind a custom SPI transport.

They want:

- a registered wireless device
- a `wiphy`
- a `wireless_dev`
- a net device that userspace can manage

That mapping happens in:

- `esp_hosted_ng/host/esp_cfg80211.c`
- plus the orchestration in `esp_hosted_ng/host/main.c`

---

## 2. The main control flow

In `main.c`, study:

- `process_esp_bootup_event(...)`
- `process_internal_event(...)`
- `process_rx_packet(...)`
- `esp_add_network_ifaces(...)`

The logic is:

1. transport receives ESP boot-up event
2. host validates the chipset
3. host learns capabilities
4. host initializes the Linux-facing interface layer
5. the Wi-Fi side gets registered

This is what turns “working protocol” into “working Linux network interface.”

Here is the exact orchestration in `main.c`:

```c
static int process_event_esp_bootup(struct esp_adapter *adapter, u8 *evt_buf, u8 len)
{
	...
	while (len_left > 0) {
		switch (*pos) {
		case ESP_BOOTUP_CAPABILITY:
			adapter->capabilities = *(pos + 2);
			break;
		case ESP_BOOTUP_FIRMWARE_CHIP_ID:
			ret = esp_validate_chipset(adapter, *(pos + 2));
			break;
		case ESP_BOOTUP_FW_DATA:
			fw_p = (struct fw_data *)(pos + 2);
			ret = process_fw_data(fw_p, tag_len);
			break;
		case ESP_BOOTUP_SPI_CLK_MHZ:
			ret = esp_adjust_spi_clock(adapter, *(pos + 2));
			break;
		}
		...
	}

	if (esp_add_card(adapter)) {
		esp_err("network interface init failed\n");
		return -1;
	}
	init_bt(adapter);
	...
}
```

This is the major control-plane jump in the codebase:

- raw boot event comes in over SPI
- driver learns what the remote chip is
- Linux-facing interfaces get built on top of that knowledge

---

## 3. The exact place where `wlan0` is created

In `main.c`, `esp_add_network_ifaces(...)` calls:

- `esp_cfg80211_add_iface(adapter->wiphy, "wlan%d", 1, NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION, NULL)`

That is the moment where the code requests a normal Linux wireless interface.

That one call is a great Embedded Linux lesson:

- the transport does not expose raw packets to userspace directly
- the driver translates the remote radio into a standard Linux interface model

That is why `nmcli`, `iw`, and other tools can work.

The call site is small enough to memorize:

```c
static int esp_add_network_ifaces(struct esp_adapter *adapter)
{
	struct wireless_dev *wdev = NULL;

	rtnl_lock();
	wdev = esp_cfg80211_add_iface(adapter->wiphy, "wlan%d", 1,
				      NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION, NULL);
	rtnl_unlock();

	if (wdev)
		return 0;

	return -1;
}
```

## 4. What `esp_cfg80211.c` contributes

Read these areas in `esp_cfg80211.c`:

- `esp_add_wiphy(...)`
- `esp_cfg80211_add_iface(...)`
- `esp_cfg80211_scan(...)`
- `esp_cfg80211_disconnect(...)`
- `esp_cfg80211_connect(...)`
- the `esp_cfg80211_ops` table

This file is your map from:

- Linux wireless subsystem expectations

to:

- command messages sent to the ESP

The major ideas are:

- create and register a `wiphy`
- declare supported bands, rates, and capabilities
- provide operation handlers for scan/connect/disconnect/etc.
- allocate and register the interface objects Linux expects

That is standard subsystem integration work. The ESP is remote, but Linux still wants the usual `cfg80211` contract.

Two short excerpts show the division of labor well.

First, `esp_add_wiphy(...)` creates and advertises the wireless capabilities Linux expects:

```c
int esp_add_wiphy(struct esp_adapter *adapter)
{
	struct wiphy *wiphy;
	...
	wiphy = wiphy_new(&esp_cfg80211_ops, sizeof(struct esp_device));
	...
	wiphy->interface_modes = BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION);
	wiphy->bands[NL80211_BAND_2GHZ] = &esp_wifi_bands_2ghz;
	...
	wiphy->max_scan_ssids = 10;
	wiphy->signal_type = CFG80211_SIGNAL_TYPE_MBM;
	wiphy->reg_notifier = esp_reg_notifier;
	...
	ret = wiphy_register(wiphy);
	return ret;
}
```

Then `esp_cfg80211_add_iface(...)` allocates the netdev and asks the ESP firmware to initialize the remote interface:

```c
struct wireless_dev *esp_cfg80211_add_iface(struct wiphy *wiphy,
		const char *name, unsigned char name_assign_type,
		enum nl80211_iftype type, struct vif_params *params)
{
	...
	ndev = ALLOC_NETDEV(sizeof(struct esp_wifi_device), name,
			    name_assign_type, ether_setup);
	...
	esp_wdev->wdev.iftype = type;
	...
	if (cmd_init_interface(esp_wdev))
		goto free_and_return;

	if (cmd_get_mac(esp_wdev))
		goto free_and_return;

	ETH_HW_ADDR_SET(ndev, esp_wdev->mac_address);
	...
	if (register_netdevice(ndev))
		goto free_and_return;
}
```

That is the Embedded Linux pattern worth learning:

- build a standard subsystem object locally
- synchronize it with the remote device through command messages
- only then register it with the kernel networking stack

## 5. Why `wlan0` is such a strong signal

`wlan0` appearing means much more than “the SPI bus works.”

It implies:

- the host transport is alive
- boot-up event handling completed far enough to initialize upper layers
- `cfg80211` registration succeeded
- interface allocation and registration succeeded

That is why the validated Jetson bring-up used `wlan0` as a major milestone.

It is the difference between:

- low-level electrical or protocol success

and:

- actual Linux subsystem success

---

## 6. What userspace is really exercising

When you run:

- `nmcli dev wifi list`
- `nmcli dev wifi connect ...`

you are indirectly testing:

- `cfg80211` hooks
- command message flow to the ESP
- event and response handling back into Linux

So a Wi-Fi scan is not “just a user command.” It is a full end-to-end test of:

- Linux subsystem registration
- transport reliability
- ESP firmware command handling

That is what makes this repo valuable as an Embedded Linux teaching example.

## Lab

Answer these:

1. Where is the `wiphy` created?
2. Where is the station interface requested?
3. Why is `wlan0` stronger proof than a successful `insmod`?
4. Which user-space command best tests the full Wi-Fi path after bring-up?

Optional:

- map `nmcli dev wifi list` to the likely `cfg80211` call path at a high level
