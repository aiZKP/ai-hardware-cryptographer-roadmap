## 1. The Bluetooth side is a separate Linux subsystem

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ride over the same host transport, but Linux does not treat them as the same thing.

For BLE, the important file is:

- `esp_hosted_ng/host/esp_bt.c`

This file integrates with the Linux HCI subsystem instead of `cfg80211`.

That is the key Embedded Linux lesson:

- one transport
- multiple Linux subsystem personalities

---

## 2. The exact code path for `hci0`

Read these functions:

- `esp_init_bt(...)`
- `esp_deinit_bt(...)`
- `esp_bt_send_frame(...)`

In `esp_init_bt(...)`, the driver:

- allocates an HCI device
- associates it with the adapter
- sets the HCI bus type
- registers the HCI device

On the SPI path, the bus becomes:

- `HCI_SPI`

That is why the validated Jetson logs and tools showed:

- `hci0`
- `Bus: SPI`

This is not cosmetic. It means Linux Bluetooth tooling now sees a standard controller interface.

The key block in `esp_bt.c` is short and very literal:

```c
int esp_init_bt(struct esp_adapter *adapter)
{
	...
	hdev = hci_alloc_dev();
	...
	adapter->hcidev = hdev;
	hci_set_drvdata(hdev, adapter);

	hdev->bus = INVALID_HDEV_BUS;
	...
	else if (adapter->if_type == ESP_IF_TYPE_SPI)
		hdev->bus = HCI_SPI;

	hdev->open  = esp_bt_open;
	hdev->close = esp_bt_close;
	hdev->flush = esp_bt_flush;
	hdev->send  = esp_bt_send_frame;
	...
	ret = hci_register_dev(hdev);
	...
}
```

That is the precise moment when “Bluetooth packets from a remote ESP” become “a normal Linux HCI controller.”

---

## 3. How incoming BLE data reaches Linux

Now return to `main.c` and re-read part of `process_rx_packet(...)`.

That function checks the incoming payload type.

When the packet is for Bluetooth:

- `payload_header->if_type == ESP_HCI_IF`

the code forwards the data to the HCI stack using:

- `hci_recv_frame(...)`

This is the crucial handoff:

- transport packet from ESP
- becomes HCI traffic in Linux

That is exactly how a custom hardware path gets translated into a standard subsystem view.

The handoff in `main.c` is direct:

```c
} else if (payload_header->if_type == ESP_HCI_IF) {
	if (hdev) {
		type = skb->data;
		hci_skb_pkt_type(skb) = *type;
		skb_pull(skb, 1);

		if (hci_recv_frame(hdev, skb)) {
			hdev->stat.err_rx++;
		} else {
			esp_hci_update_rx_counter(hdev, *type, skb->len);
		}
	}
}
```

The transport does not expose a custom user API for BLE. It converts remote packets into the standard HCI receive path that BlueZ already understands.

## 4. What the capability logs are telling you

In `main.c`, the capability printout tells you what the ESP claims to support.

On the validated Jetson path, the logs showed:

- `BT/BLE`
- `HCI over SPI`
- `BLE only`

That last point matters for **ESP32-C6**:

- this path is **BLE-only**
- do not expect classic Bluetooth audio profiles from this configuration

That is a practical product constraint, not just a code detail.

The capability reporting comes from `main.c` and is worth scanning once in real code:

```c
if (cap & ESP_BT_SPI_SUPPORT)
	esp_info("\t   - HCI over SPI\n");

if ((cap & ESP_BLE_ONLY_SUPPORT) && (cap & ESP_BR_EDR_ONLY_SUPPORT))
	esp_info("\t   - BT/BLE dual mode\n");
else if (cap & ESP_BLE_ONLY_SUPPORT)
	esp_info("\t   - BLE only\n");
else if (cap & ESP_BR_EDR_ONLY_SUPPORT)
	esp_info("\t   - BR EDR only\n");
```

Those log lines are not decoration. They are the driver telling you how the remote firmware wants Linux to treat the radio.

## 5. The validated Linux-side BLE proof

On real hardware, the validation path was:

- `hciconfig -a`
- `bluetoothctl list`
- `bluetoothctl`
- `scan on`

And the proof points were:

- `hci0` existed
- BlueZ recognized the controller
- the controller bus reported `SPI`
- BLE scan discovered nearby devices

That means the BLE path was not just registered. It was functional.

This is important:

- `hci0` appearing is good
- `scan on` finding devices is much better

That is the same lesson you saw with Wi-Fi:

- appearance is not the same as validated behavior

---

## 6. End-to-end success criteria for this codebase

For this Jetson case study, full success means:

- transport up
- boot-up event received
- chipset validated
- `wlan0` created
- Wi-Fi scan works
- `hci0` created
- BLE scan works

That is the right Embedded Linux mindset:

- validate at the subsystem level the operating system actually cares about
- not just at the signal or module-insert level

---

## Final lab

Answer these:

1. Where is the HCI device allocated?
2. Where is the HCI bus type set to SPI?
3. Where do incoming Bluetooth packets get handed to Linux?
4. Why is `scan on` stronger evidence than `bluetoothctl list` alone?
5. Why does this repo make a good Embedded Linux case study for subsystem integration?

Optional extension:

- write a short comparison of:
  - `cfg80211` integration for Wi-Fi
  - HCI integration for BLE
- identify what is shared between them and what is subsystem-specific
