# ARM MCU, FreeRTOS, and Communication Protocols

*Follows [**Phase 2 section 1 — Schematic Capture and PCB Design**](../1.%20Schematic%20Capture%20and%20PCB%20Design/Guide.md) when you are bringing up **custom hardware**; dev-kit learners can start here in parallel. Builds on Phase 1 (digital, HDL, architecture, OS) — focuses on ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, RTOS practice, and buses (SPI/UART/I2C/CAN) that connect sensors and peripherals.*

---

## 1. ARM Cortex-M Architecture

### Cortex-M Core Variants

* **Cortex-M0/M0+, M3, M4, M7, M33/M55:** Understand differences across the family — instruction sets (Thumb, Thumb-2), presence of FPU (M4/M7), DSP extensions (M4/M7), and security extensions (TrustZone-M on M23/M33/M55).
* **CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard):** Master CMSIS-Core for hardware abstraction, CMSIS-DSP for signal processing, CMSIS-NN for neural network inference on Cortex-M. These libraries are how production embedded and TinyML code targets ARM hardware.
* **ARM TrustZone-M (Cortex-M33/M55):** Hardware-enforced security partitioning — secure and non-secure worlds, secure boot, trusted execution environments (TEE). Directly relevant to IoT security and edge AI deployment.

### Memory System and MPU

* **Harvard vs. Von Neumann:** Cortex-M uses a modified Harvard architecture with separate instruction and data buses — understand implications for cache behavior and DMA.
* **Memory-Mapped Peripherals:** All peripherals (GPIO, timers, UART, SPI, I2C) are accessed via memory addresses — registers are just addresses. Master this model to write low-level drivers.
* **MPU (Memory Protection Unit):** Configure memory regions with access permissions (read/write/execute) to isolate tasks, detect stack overflows, and catch errant pointer writes. Essential for robust production firmware.
* **Stack Overflow Detection:** Use MPU guard regions and hardware stack protection to trigger controlled HardFault on overflow rather than undefined behavior.

### CPU Internals

* **Instruction Set (Thumb-2):** Cortex-M executes Thumb-2 — a mix of 16- and 32-bit instructions. Understand how the compiler targets this ISA and where inline assembly is useful (e.g., `__disable_irq()`, `__DSB()`).
* **Pipeline and Interrupts:** 3-stage pipeline (M0/M3) or 6-stage with branch prediction (M7). Understand how interrupt latency is determined and how `NVIC` (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller) manages priority and preemption.
* **Exception Model:** HardFault, MemManage, BusFault, UsageFault — implement fault handlers that capture register state and stack trace to flash for post-mortem debugging.

### RISC-V for Embedded (Comparison Track)

* **RISC-V ISA and Extensions:** Modular ISA — RV32I base + M (multiply), A (atomics), F/D (float), C (compressed). Learn how to evaluate which extensions to enable for your application.
* **Embedded Platforms:** SiFive FE310, ESP32-C3, GD32VF103 or FPGA-based soft cores (PicoRV32, VexRiscv on Zynq/Arty). Running FreeRTOS on a RISC-V soft core is a strong Phase 3 bridge project.

## 2. C Programming for ARM Embedded Systems

### Memory Management

* **Allocation Strategies:** Static allocation (globals, BSS), stack allocation, and when (and when not) to use heap (`malloc`/`free`) in embedded. Understand fragmentation and why many embedded systems avoid dynamic allocation entirely.
* **Memory Sections:** `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`, `.rodata` — know where code and data live in flash vs. RAM and how the linker script controls this. Critical for Cortex-M startup code and `__attribute__((section(...)))`.
* **DMA (Direct Memory Access):** Transfer data between peripherals and memory without CPU involvement. Understanding DMA descriptors, cache coherency issues (`__DSB()`, `SCB_CleanDCache()`), and interrupt-based completion is essential for high-throughput I/O.

### Bit Manipulation and Register Access

* **CMSIS-style register access:** Use `typedef struct` + `volatile` + bitfields or `uint32_t` masks for register access. Write portable drivers that work at the register level without HAL overhead.
* **Bit masking patterns:** `SET_BIT()`, `CLEAR_BIT()`, `READ_BIT()` macros, bit-banding on Cortex-M3/M4. Master these to write ISRs and driver code that is both correct and fast.

### Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)

* **NVIC priority configuration:** `NVIC_SetPriority()`, priority grouping, and preemption. Understand how to set priorities to ensure time-critical ISRs preempt lower-priority handlers.
* **Minimal ISRs:** Keep ISRs short — set a flag or post to a queue, do work in task context. This is the bridge from bare-metal to RTOS design.
* **Volatile and memory barriers:** Use `volatile` correctly for shared variables between ISR and main context. Use `__DSB()` / `__ISB()` where needed.

**Resources:**
* *"C Programming for Embedded Systems"* — Kirk Zurell.
* STM32 HAL source code — read the HAL implementation to understand how vendor drivers map to CMSIS register access.
* ARM Application Notes: AN321 (CMSIS), AN298 (Cortex-M memory system).

**Projects:**
* **Circular buffer + DMA UART:** Implement a lockless circular buffer fed by DMA in UART receive mode. Handle overflow and demonstrate zero-copy receive in an ISR.
* **Custom peripheral driver:** Write a bare-metal driver (no HAL) for a SPI sensor (e.g., IMU) from the datasheet, using CMSIS register access and interrupt-driven completion.

## 3. FreeRTOS

### Core RTOS Concepts

* **Tasks and Scheduling:** Create tasks with `xTaskCreate()`, assign priorities, and understand preemptive scheduling. Know when the scheduler runs (tick ISR, `taskYIELD()`, blocking calls).
* **Scheduling Algorithms:** Preemptive fixed-priority, time-slicing for equal-priority tasks, and co-operative mode. Understand priority inversion and how to prevent it with priority inheritance mutexes.
* **Task States:** Running, Ready, Blocked, Suspended. Trace task state transitions to diagnose scheduling issues.

### Inter-Task Communication

* **Queues:** `xQueueSend()` / `xQueueReceive()` — the primary IPC mechanism. Use from both task and ISR context (`xQueueSendFromISR()`). Understand blocking with timeouts.
* **Semaphores and Mutexes:** Binary semaphore for signaling (ISR → task), counting semaphore for resource counting, mutex for mutual exclusion with priority inheritance.
* **Event Groups:** Synchronize multiple tasks or ISRs with bit-flags. `xEventGroupSetBits()` / `xEventGroupWaitBits()` — useful for state machines and multi-source synchronization.
* **Stream and Message Buffers:** Efficient byte-stream or framed-message passing between tasks and ISRs, lower overhead than queues for bulk data.

### Memory Management

* **Heap schemes (heap_1 through heap_5):** Choose the right allocator — heap_1 (no free), heap_4 (best-fit, most common), heap_5 (non-contiguous regions). Monitor `xPortGetFreeHeapSize()` and `uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark()`.
* **Static allocation:** Use `xTaskCreateStatic()` / `xQueueCreateStatic()` to place TCBs and stacks in statically-defined arrays — eliminates heap use entirely, required in safety-critical designs.

### Configuration and Debugging

* **FreeRTOSConfig.h:** Tune `configTICK_RATE_HZ`, `configMAX_PRIORITIES`, `configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE`, `configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY`. Every option has a cost — understand the trade-offs.
* **Runtime stats:** Enable `configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS` to measure per-task CPU time. Use `vTaskList()` / `vTaskGetRunTimeStats()` for a text-format system snapshot.
* **FreeRTOS+Trace (Tracealyzer):** Instrument your application with Percepio Tracealyzer or Segger SystemView to visualize task switching, queue operations, and interrupt latency in a timeline.
* **Stack overflow hooks:** Enable `configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW` (method 1 or 2) and implement `vApplicationStackOverflowHook()` to catch overflows at runtime.

**Resources:**
* *"Using the FreeRTOS Real Time Kernel: A Practical Guide"* — Richard Barry. The canonical reference.

* **RS-232 vs. TTL vs. RS-485:** Voltage levels, drivers, and when to use a line driver IC. RS-485 for differential multi-drop buses (industrial sensors, motor drives).

### Driver Implementation

* **Interrupt-driven UART with circular buffer:** TX and RX paths each backed by a circular buffer. ISR fills/drains the buffer; application reads/writes without blocking.
* **DMA UART receive:** Use DMA in circular mode for RX to capture incoming bytes without per-byte interrupts. Use half-complete and complete DMA callbacks plus idle-line detection to handle variable-length frames.
* **UART with FreeRTOS:** Protect the TX buffer with a mutex, signal received frames via queue or stream buffer to a processing task. Demonstrate zero-copy receive with direct-to-task DMA.

**Projects:**
* **UART bootloader:** Implement a bootloader that receives a firmware binary over UART (e.g., XMODEM protocol), writes it to flash, and jumps to the new application after verification.

## 9. IoT Networking and OpenThread

### Why This Belongs in Embedded Software

Once a firmware engineer moves beyond a single board and a single peripheral, the next real problem is not just "read a sensor" but "keep a secure, low-power network alive for months." IoT protocols sit directly on top of your timers, UART/SPI links, radio drivers, storage, and power states, which is why they belong in the embedded-software track instead of being treated as a separate cloud topic.

OpenThread is a strong first protocol here because it combines **embedded constraints** with **real networking structure**. You have to understand 802.15.4 radios, low-power timing, packet formats, IPv6, commissioning, host-controller links, and border routers as one coherent system.

### OpenThread as the First IoT Protocol

Thread is an IPv6-based, low-power mesh network built on IEEE 802.15.4. OpenThread is the open-source implementation that makes this concrete on real hardware, including SoC-style MCU designs and Linux-host-plus-radio-co-processor designs.

This makes OpenThread especially relevant to the rest of the roadmap. The same concepts show up later when you build a Thread RCP on an ESP32-C6, attach it to a Jetson over UART, and let Linux run the higher-level OpenThread stack while the small radio chip handles 802.15.4.

Start here:
