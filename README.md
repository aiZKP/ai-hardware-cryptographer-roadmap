## What is this?

This repository is a **hardware-first roadmap** for people who want to become AI hardware engineers.

It sits in the gap between "I can use AI frameworks" and "I can explain how models map onto compilers, runtimes, boards, and chips." The repository connects the layers that are usually learned separately: digital design, computer architecture, operating systems, parallel programming, embedded systems, AI workloads, deployment, ML compilers, and accelerator design.

The goal is not to collect random resources or to teach generic AI in isolation. The goal is to build **cross-stack engineering judgment**: how workloads create bottlenecks, how software reaches hardware, and how to design, optimize, deploy, or debug AI systems close to the silicon.

AI content in this repository exists to teach the workloads that hardware must serve. The center of gravity is still **hardware, systems, deployment, and performance**.

**By the end, you should be able to:**

- trace an AI workload from model code to compiler, runtime, and hardware behavior
- write and profile performance-critical code, including GPU and parallel workloads
- deploy AI on real embedded or programmable hardware such as Jetson and FPGA platforms
- reason about memory, latency, throughput, precision, and architecture tradeoffs

---

## Who is this for?

This repository is for engineers who want to move into **AI hardware work**, not just use AI tools at a high level.

It is built for people crossing into a neighboring layer of the stack:
- from software into performance, compilers, and hardware behavior
- from ML into deployment, systems, and runtime constraints
- from embedded into AI products and accelerator-backed inference
- from hardware into workloads, compiler flow, and software integration

- **Software Engineer:** Move from APIs and infrastructure into CUDA, runtime behavior, compiler flow, memory hierarchy, and accelerator execution.
- **ML / AI Engineer:** Connect quantization, batching, graph lowering, deployment, and inference behavior to the hardware limits that actually shape performance.
- **Embedded / Firmware Engineer:** Extend RTOS, Linux, drivers, BSP, and bring-up skills into Jetson, edge inference, sensor pipelines, and shipped AI devices.
- **Computer Science Student:** Use a structured path from fundamentals to systems, workloads, deployment, and specialization instead of guessing what to study next.
- **Hardware / RTL / FPGA Engineer:** Add workload intuition, compiler context, kernels, and deployment constraints so existing hardware knowledge maps to real AI systems.

---

## AI Chip Stack

This roadmap uses an **8-layer stack** to explain AI hardware work end to end. The point is not just to label layers. The point is to understand how decisions in one layer affect the others, from application code at the top to implementation and fabrication at the bottom.

> **L1–L6:** Hands-on throughout this roadmap.
> **L7–L8:** Included so the stack stays complete, with guided conceptual labs.

## Where Do I Start?

Pick the path that matches both your current background and your target role. Most people should choose one primary entry path first, then branch out later.

- **Software / ML:** Start with execution and performance. Path: `Phase 1 (C++ / Parallel) -> Phase 3 -> Phase 4C or 4B`. Best if you already build models or infrastructure and want to understand kernels, memory behavior, compiler lowering, and deployment constraints.
- **Embedded / Firmware:** Start with systems and deployment. Path: `Phase 1 (Architecture) -> Phase 2 -> Phase 4B`. Best if you already know boards, RTOS, buses, or Linux bring-up and want to move into edge AI products.
- **Already know CUDA:** Jump to specialized tracks. Path: `Phase 4A / 4B / 4C`. Best if profiling, kernels, and low-level performance already feel familiar.
- **Chip design target:** Follow the full hardware path. Path: `Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 4A -> Phase 5F`. Best if your goal is accelerator architecture, FPGA prototyping, RTL implementation, or silicon-adjacent work.

## How To Use This Roadmap

Do not treat this repository like a book to finish once. Use it like a build-and-measure curriculum.

1. Read the theory
2. Build the subsystem or implementation
3. Measure performance, power, correctness, or utilization
4. Ship one reusable artifact

The artifact matters as much as the reading. Good outputs include a CUDA profile, TensorRT benchmark, device-tree patch, FPGA timing report, compiler experiment, or architecture write-up. The point is to leave each block with evidence of engineering work, not just notes.

Before you start, decide three things:

1. Which role or stack layer you are aiming at. Start with [Roles & Market Analysis](Roles%20and%20Market%20Analysis.md).
2. What hardware and toolchain you can actually use.
3. How you will track outputs, failures, measurements, and decisions.
