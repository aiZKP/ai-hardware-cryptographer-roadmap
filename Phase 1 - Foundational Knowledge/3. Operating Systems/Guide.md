# Operating Systems (Phase 1 §3)

**Primary source:** [Caltech CS124 Spring 2024](https://users.cms.caltech.edu/~donnie/cs124/lectures/) (Donnie Pinkston).

This section is the **OS theory + Linux-shaped practice** layer of Phase 1. It sits after [**§2 — Computer Architecture**](../2.%20Computer%20Architecture%20and%20Hardware/Guide.md) (you need CPU/memory context) and before [**§4 — C++ and Parallel Computing**](../4.%20C%2B%2B%20and%20Parallel%20Computing/Guide.md) (you will use processes, threads, and VM ideas when writing host and CUDA code).

**Why it matters for AI hardware:** Deployed stacks run on Linux (Jetson, ADAS, servers) or smaller RTOSes. Scheduling, virtual memory, I/O, and the user/kernel boundary are what you tune when chasing latency, debugging drivers, or reasoning about zero-copy camera → GPU paths.

## How this folder is laid out

Everything you need is **under this directory**—there is no separate “side” tree next to `Lectures/`.

| Location | Role |
|----------|------|
| **`Lectures/Lecture-NN.md`** | Main notes for **26** topics (see index below). |
| **`Lectures/Lecture-Note-NN.md`** | Optional deeper notes where present. |
| **`Lectures/demos/rt-demo/`** | Small **user-space** C demo tying **Lectures 1–9** to runnable code ([README](Lectures/demos/rt-demo/README.md)). |
| **`Final-Test-Problems.md`** | Five integration problems with explicit lecture cross-links. |

**Study flow:** Read lectures in the thematic order below → use **rt-demo** after you finish **L9** (optional but useful) → attempt **Final-Test-Problems** near the end of the section.

## Course snapshot

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Base curriculum** | Caltech CS124 — concepts, slides, and pacing |
| **Write-ups in this repo** | **26** markdown lectures (including capstone-style **L25** and **L26** extensions aligned with this roadmap) |
| **Prerequisites** | C programming; Phase 1 §2 (architecture / memory hierarchy) |
| **Classic hands-on (external)** | [Pintos](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/) — Stanford teaching kernel (threads, user programs, VM, files) |

---

## Recommended order (by theme)

Follow this order rather than skipping around; later lectures assume earlier vocabulary.

1. **System shape & boot (L1–L5)** — history, UNIX I/O, traps and structure, microkernels, firmware/boot.
2. **Concurrency in the kernel model (L6–L9)** — processes, threads, interrupt context, synchronization and deadlock.  
   *Optional:* build and run **[rt-demo](Lectures/demos/rt-demo/README.md)** here to connect syscalls, scheduling, affinity, and pthread primitives to real code.
3. **Scheduling (L10–L12)** — advanced sync, CPU scheduling, real-time and Linux schedulers.
4. **User/kernel boundary (L13–L14)** — system calls, signals.
5. **Memory (L15–L20)** — virtual memory, page tables, replacement, thrashing, Pintos VM discussion.
6. **Filesystems (L21–L24)** — allocation, locking, SSDs, Pintos FS design, journaling.
7. **Integration (L25–L26)** — Yocto capstone tie-in; eBPF / observability.

## Practice

1. **[Final-Test-Problems.md](Final-Test-Problems.md)** — five problems (kernel build, PREEMPT_RT, ext4, boot chain, modules + DT); each points to specific lectures.
2. **[Lectures/demos/rt-demo/](Lectures/demos/rt-demo/README.md)** — one program for **L1–L9** (scheduling, affinity, `mlockall`, pthread sync). Requires Linux or WSL.
