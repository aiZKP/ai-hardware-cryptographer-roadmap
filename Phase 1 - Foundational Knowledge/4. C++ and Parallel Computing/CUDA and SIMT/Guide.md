## 1. Why GPU? — The Transistor Budget

CPUs dedicate most transistors to control logic and cache (latency minimization). GPUs dedicate most transistors to arithmetic units (throughput maximization).

| | CPU | GPU |
|--|-----|-----|
| Core count | 8–128 | 1,000s–10,000s |
| Clock speed | 3–5 GHz | 1.5–2.5 GHz |
| Design goal | Low latency (single thread) | High throughput (many threads) |
| Cache | Large (MB per core) | Small (KB per SM) |
| Control flow | Complex OOO, branch prediction | Simple, in-order per lane |
| Memory BW | ~50–200 GB/s | ~900–3,500 GB/s (HBM) |

**The key insight:** GPUs hide memory latency by switching to other warps while waiting, not by predicting and prefetching. This requires thousands of in-flight threads.

## 2. Heterogeneous Programming Model

A CUDA application always starts on the CPU (host). The host copies data to the GPU (device), launches kernels, and waits for results.

```

 │  Host (CPU)                          Device (GPU)
 │  ──────────                          ────────────

 │  (async — returns immediately)                          Kernel starts
 │  Can do CPU work here                                   Grid of blocks
 │                                                         Threads execute
 │  cudaDeviceSynchronize() ─── blocks ──────────────────────────────────┐
 │                                                         Results in mem │
 ▼  Copies results D→H ◄──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key rules:**
- CPU and GPU have **separate DRAM** — data must be explicitly transferred (unless using Unified Memory)
- Kernel launches are **asynchronous** — the CPU continues while the GPU works
- `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` blocks the CPU until all GPU work completes

## 3. GPU Hardware Architecture

### 3.1 The Full Chip

A GPU die is organized as a hierarchy:

```

└── GPC (Graphics Processing Cluster) × N
    └── TPC (Texture Processing Cluster) × M
        └── SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) × 2
            ├── Warp Schedulers × 4

            ├── Register File (256 KB)
            ├── Shared Memory / L1 Cache (up to 228 KB)

```

### 3.2 The Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)

The SM is the fundamental execution unit. All threads in one block run on **one SM**. The SM executes warps — groups of 32 threads that run the same instruction in lockstep (SIMT).

![H100 SM internal diagram](../../../Assets/images/h100-sm-diagram.png)

*H100 SM: 4 warp schedulers, 128 FP32 CUDA cores, 4 Tensor Cores (4th gen), 256 KB register file, up to 228 KB shared mem / L1. Source: NVIDIA*

**H100 SM components:**

| Component | Count | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Warp schedulers | 4 | Each selects one ready warp per cycle |
| Dispatch units | 8 (2 per scheduler) | Issue instructions to execution units |
| FP32 CUDA cores | 128 | Floating-point arithmetic |
| INT32 units | 64 | Integer arithmetic — runs **simultaneously** with FP32 |
| Tensor Cores (4th gen) | 4 | Matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) for ML |
| Register file | 256 KB | Per-thread fastest storage, compiler-allocated |
| Shared mem / L1 | 228 KB | Configurable split between the two |

**Execution pipeline — how a kernel actually runs:**

```
kernel launch
     │
     ▼
Threads grouped into warps (32 threads each)
     │
     ▼
Warp Schedulers (×4) — each cycle, pick one ready warp
     │   A warp is "ready" when:
     │     - all operands are available
     │     - no memory stall
     │     - no data dependency
     ▼
Dispatch Units (×8) — issue 2 instructions per scheduler per cycle
     │   → 4 × 2 = up to 8 instructions issued per clock cycle
     ▼
Execution Units
     ├── FP32 cores  — floating-point ops (add, mul, fma)
     ├── INT32 units — integer ops, address calculation  ← runs in parallel with FP32
     └── Tensor Cores — MMA: D = A×B + C in one instruction
     │
     ▼
Register file (results written back per-thread)
Shared memory / L1 (for loads/stores)
```

**Latency hiding — the core GPU performance mechanism:**

GPU memory latency is ~hundreds of cycles. Instead of stalling, the scheduler instantly switches to another ready warp:

```
cycle:   1    2    3    ...  200   201  202
Warp 0:  [issue load] ──── stalled waiting for memory ────► [use result]
Warp 1:       [execute] [execute] [execute] ...
Warp 2:                 [execute] [execute] ...
Warp 3:                           [execute] ...
         ↑
    While warp 0 waits, warps 1–3 fill the execution units — zero idle cycles
```

This is why GPUs require **thousands of in-flight threads**: more threads = more warps = more latency hiding capacity. A kernel with too few threads leaves the SM partially idle.

**FP32 + INT32 dual execution:**

FP32 cores and INT32 units can issue in the same cycle. A common pattern in GPU kernels is computing a float result while simultaneously computing the next memory address:

```
cycle N:   FP32: result[i] = a[i] * b[i]
           INT32: next_addr = base + (i+1) * stride   ← free — uses different units
```

**Tensor Core operation:**

A Tensor Core computes a 16×16 matrix multiply-accumulate in one instruction:

```
D = A × B + C     (D, A, B, C are 16×16 tiles)
```

vs CUDA core equivalent: 16×16×16 = 4,096 multiply-adds → 4,096 separate FP32 instructions. One Tensor Core instruction replaces thousands of scalar ops.

**Register file and occupancy tradeoff:**

```
256 KB register file shared by all warps on the SM

Thread uses 32 registers:  256 KB / (32 regs × 4 B) = 2048 threads max → 64 warps
Thread uses 64 registers:  256 KB / (64 regs × 4 B) = 1024 threads max → 32 warps
Thread uses 128 registers: 256 KB / (128 regs × 4 B) = 512 threads max → 16 warps

Fewer active warps → less latency hiding → lower occupancy → lower throughput
```

The compiler minimizes register usage to keep occupancy high. Check with `nvcc --ptxas-options=-v` to see per-kernel register count.

**Shared memory / L1 split (Hopper):**

```
228 KB total ← configurable at kernel launch
├── Shared memory: 0 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64 / 100 / 132 / 164 / 196 / 228 KB
└── L1 cache:      remainder

More shared memory → better for kernels with thread cooperation (matmul tiling)
More L1            → better for streaming workloads with irregular access
```

Set with: `cudaFuncSetAttribute(kernel, cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize, size)`

**Common SM-level bottlenecks:**

| Bottleneck | Cause | Fix |
|------------|-------|-----|
| Warp divergence | Threads in same warp take different branches → half the units idle | Restructure code to minimize per-thread branching |
| Memory latency not hidden | Too few warps per SM (low occupancy) | Reduce registers/shared mem per thread, increase block size |
| Register pressure | Too many live variables → spill to local memory (slow) | Reduce variable scope, use `__launch_bounds__` |
| Bank conflicts | Multiple threads access same shared memory bank | Pad shared arrays or stagger access patterns |
| Uncoalesced global access | Threads access non-contiguous addresses → multiple transactions | Ensure thread N accesses element N (stride-1 access) |

### 3.3 Warp Scheduler, L0 Cache, and Dual-Issue

**Warp scheduler internals:**

Each of the 4 schedulers owns a subset of the SM's active warps and runs the same decision loop every clock cycle:

```
every cycle, for each scheduler:
  1. scan assigned warps
  2. filter: keep only warps where all operands are ready (scoreboard check)
  3. pick one ready warp (typically greedy-then-oldest policy)
  4. issue up to 2 independent instructions from that warp → dispatch units
```

The **scoreboard** tracks register readiness. When an instruction is issued, its destination registers are marked "pending". Once the result is written back, the registers are cleared. Any warp that tries to read a pending register is stalled and skipped that cycle — no explicit hardware lock needed.

```
Warp A issues: r4 = r0 * r1   → r4 marked PENDING
Warp A issues: r5 = r4 + r2   → r4 still PENDING → warp A STALLED
Scheduler     → skips warp A, picks warp B instead (zero-cost switch)
...N cycles later...
r4 result written back → r4 cleared → warp A becomes READY again
```

**Warp pool partitioning (H100 example):**

```
SM: up to 64 warps active (2048 threads ÷ 32)
  Scheduler 0 → warps  0–15
  Scheduler 1 → warps 16–31
  Scheduler 2 → warps 32–47
  Scheduler 3 → warps 48–63
```

Each scheduler is independent — its stalls do not block the other three.

**L0 instruction cache:**

Between the warp scheduler and the instruction memory sits a tiny per-scheduler L0 cache. It holds decoded instructions for the active warps assigned to that scheduler.

```
Warp scheduler
      │
      ▼
  L0 cache (hit → ~0 cycles)
      │ miss
      ▼
  L1 instruction cache
      │ miss
      ▼
  L2 → HBM  (expensive)
```

L0 is rarely discussed but critical: without it, every instruction issue would require an L1 read, capping throughput. In practice, L0 hit rates are very high because GPU code has high instruction reuse (same loop body issued to thousands of warps).

**CUDA core — what it is and isn't:**

A CUDA core is a single-precision ALU. It executes one FP32 operation per cycle for one thread's data:

```
supported: add, mul, fma(a,b,c) = a×b+c, min, max, comparison
not its job: memory loads/stores (load-store units), scheduling (warp scheduler), matrix ops (Tensor Cores)
```

FMA (`fused multiply-add`) is the dominant operation in AI workloads — it performs `a×b+c` in one instruction with a single rounding step, which is both faster and more numerically accurate than separate mul + add.

Threads run in warps of 32. One warp issues one instruction and all 32 threads execute it in parallel across 32 CUDA cores. The SM has 128 cores total, which aligns with the 4 schedulers:

```
4 schedulers × 1 warp × 32 threads = 128 threads issuing FP32 per cycle
                                   = 128 CUDA cores fully occupied at peak

instruction: C[i] = A[i] * B[i] + D[i]   (FMA, warp of 32 threads)
                 │
    ┌────────────┼─────────────┐
    T0→core 0   T1→core 1  ...  T31→core 31   ← one warp, 32 cores, same cycle
```

**Important — resident warps vs active warps:**

```
Resident warps (H100):  up to 64 per SM  (2048 threads ÷ 32)
                             ↑
          all held in registers, ready to schedule at any time

Active warps per cycle:  4  (one per scheduler)
                             ↑
          the 4 currently issuing instructions this clock cycle

CUDA cores are NOT statically assigned to warps.
Any warp can use any cores — the scheduler dynamically routes each cycle.
```

Think of it as a flow, not a fixed assignment: the 64 resident warps are a pool the scheduler draws from every cycle, routing whichever 4 are ready into the 128 cores. The large resident pool is what enables latency hiding — while 4 warps execute, 60 others are waiting on memory or dependencies, ready to replace any that stall.

**Dual-issue — when two instructions issue in one cycle:**

Each warp scheduler can issue up to 2 instructions per cycle to different execution units. This is **not** two ops on the same unit — it's exploiting independent pipelines simultaneously.

```
✓  FP32 + INT32       → different pipelines, no conflict
✓  FP32 + load/store  → different units
✓  INT32 + Tensor Core→ different units

✗  FP32 + FP32        → same pipeline, serialized
✗  dependent ops      → second reads register written by first, must wait
```

Concrete dual-issue example — computing a value while calculating the next index:

```
cycle N, warp A, instruction slot 1:  r4 = r0 * r1        (FP32 → CUDA cores)
cycle N, warp A, instruction slot 2:  r5 = r2 + 1         (INT32 → integer units)
                                            ↑ free — uses a completely separate pipeline
```

The compiler (NVCC → ptxas) schedules instruction order to maximize dual-issue opportunities. You can inspect the result with `cuobjdump --dump-sass binary.cubin` — back-to-back independent FP32+INT32 pairs indicate successful dual-issue scheduling.

**Instruction-level vs warp-level parallelism:**

```
warp-level parallelism (TLP):            instruction-level parallelism (ILP):
  many warps in flight                     independent instructions within one warp
  hides memory latency                     fills multiple pipelines per cycle
  requires high occupancy                  requires dependency-free code sequences

  T0 T1 T2 ... T63  ← different warps     x = a*b;   ← FP32
  all in scheduler                         y = c+d;   ← also FP32 (serialized)
  switch on stall                          i = n+1;   ← INT32 (can dual-issue with either)
```

Both matter. TLP is the primary mechanism (latency hiding); ILP squeezes extra throughput when warps are available.

**Cycle-level summary — one SM, one clock:**

```
clock edge
    │
    ├─ Scheduler 0: picks warp A → issues FP32 + INT32 to dispatch units
    ├─ Scheduler 1: picks warp C → issues FP32 to dispatch units (warp B stalled)
    ├─ Scheduler 2: picks warp E → issues Tensor Core op
    └─ Scheduler 3: all warps stalled (memory) → issues nothing this cycle

dispatch units → route to:
    FP32 cores  (×128) → execute 32-thread FMA
    INT32 units (×64)  → execute 32-thread add
    Tensor Core (×4)   → execute 16×16 MMA

register file → results written back → scoreboards updated → stalled warps unblock
```

Maximum theoretical: 4 schedulers × 2 instructions = **8 instructions issued per clock cycle** on one SM.

### 3.4 Latency Hiding — The Core Magic of GPUs

This is the single most important concept in GPU architecture. Once you see it, everything about SM design, occupancy, and kernel optimization clicks.

**What "latency" means here:**

Every global memory load takes **300–500 cycles** to return. On a CPU, that means 300 cycles of doing nothing — the core stalls. On a GPU, the warp scheduler **instantly switches to another warp** and keeps the hardware busy.

```
The CPU approach (hide latency with cache):

  Thread requests data → L1 miss → L2 miss → DRAM → 300 cycles stall
                                                      ↑
                                              Core does NOTHING for 300 cycles
                                              (branch predictor + prefetch help, but stalls still happen)

The GPU approach (hide latency with parallelism):

  Warp A requests data → stalls                        ← warp A goes to sleep
  Warp B runs          → stalls                        ← warp B goes to sleep
  Warp C runs          → stalls
  Warp D runs          → computes (no stall!)
  Warp E runs          → computes
  ...
  Warp A's data arrives → warp A runs again            ← warp A wakes up

  SM NEVER IDLES as long as some warp is ready
```

**Step-by-step timeline — what happens inside one SM:**

```
64 resident warps, 4 schedulers, global memory latency = 200 cycles

Cycle 1:    Scheduler 0 picks Warp 0  → issues LOAD from global memory
            Scheduler 1 picks Warp 16 → issues FMA (compute)
            Scheduler 2 picks Warp 32 → issues FMA (compute)
            Scheduler 3 picks Warp 48 → issues LOAD from global memory

Cycle 2:    Warp 0 stalled (waiting for memory)
            Warp 48 stalled (waiting for memory)
            Scheduler 0 picks Warp 1  → issues FMA       ← instantly switched!
            Scheduler 3 picks Warp 49 → issues FMA       ← no idle cycle!

Cycle 3:    Scheduler 0 picks Warp 2  → issues FMA
            ...

Cycle 200:  Warp 0's data arrives from DRAM
            Warp 0 becomes READY again
            Next time Scheduler 0 has a free slot → picks Warp 0

Result: 200 cycles of "waiting" consumed ZERO idle cycles
        because 63 other warps filled the gap
```

**Why warp switching is free:**

On a CPU, context switching saves/restores registers to memory (~1000 cycles). On a GPU, **every warp's registers are already on-chip** in the 256 KB register file — permanently allocated at kernel launch. Switching warps means the scheduler just picks a different warp ID. No save, no restore, no overhead.

```
CPU context switch:                    GPU warp switch:
  Save 16 registers to stack            Do nothing — registers already on-chip
  Load 16 registers from stack          Scheduler picks different warp ID
  Flush/refill pipeline                 Next cycle: new warp's instruction issues
  ~1000 cycles                          ~0 cycles
```

This is why the register file is 256 KB — it holds ALL warps' registers simultaneously. The trade-off: more registers per thread = fewer warps can fit = less latency hiding.

**The chef analogy:**

```
CPU = one chef, one dish at a time:
  Start soup → wait for stock to boil (300 seconds) → chef stands idle
  Total: 300 seconds of waiting per dish

GPU = one chef, 64 dishes in parallel:
  Start soup     → put on stove (waiting)
  Start salad    → chopping (active)
  Start bread    → kneading (active)
  Start sauce    → simmering (waiting)
  Check soup     → stock ready! Continue soup
  ...
  Chef is NEVER idle — always has another dish to work on

  64 dishes, each takes 300 seconds of waiting
  But chef serves all 64 in ~350 total seconds (not 64 × 300 = 19,200)
```

**When latency hiding fails — and what to do:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| SM utilization <50% | Too few warps (low occupancy) | Reduce registers/thread, increase block size |
| All warps stalled simultaneously | Every warp hit the same memory barrier | Restructure access to avoid all-warp synchronization |
| High occupancy but low throughput | Memory bandwidth saturated (all warps waiting on DRAM) | Reduce memory traffic: tile, quantize, fuse ops |
| Occupancy limited by shared memory | Each block uses too much shared memory | Reduce tile size, use registers instead where possible |
| Occupancy limited by registers | Complex kernel needs many registers | Use `__launch_bounds__`, simplify computations, split kernel |

**The occupancy sweet spot:**

```
Occupancy = active warps / max warps (64 on H100)

  Occupancy   Latency hiding   Performance
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  <25%        Poor              Bad — SM often idle
  25–50%      Adequate          Good for compute-bound kernels
  50–75%      Good              Good for most kernels
  75–100%     Excellent         Best for memory-bound kernels

  Rule of thumb: aim for >50% occupancy as a starting point
  But: high occupancy ≠ fast kernel (memory-bound kernel at 100% occupancy
       is still slow if it's hitting bandwidth ceiling)
```

**Measuring occupancy:**

```bash
# At compile time: theoretical occupancy
nvcc --ptxas-options=-v my_kernel.cu
# Output: "Used 32 registers, 4096 bytes smem" → plug into occupancy calculator

# At runtime: achieved occupancy
ncu --metrics sm__warps_active.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_active ./my_program
# Output: 68.5% → 68.5% of max warps were active on average

# NVIDIA Occupancy Calculator (Excel spreadsheet):
# Input: registers/thread, shared mem/block, block size
# Output: theoretical occupancy, limiting factor
```

**The key mental model:**

```
GPUs don't make individual operations faster.
GPUs hide the wait time by doing other work.

1 warp waiting 200 cycles          = 200 wasted cycles
64 warps, each waiting 200 cycles  = 0 wasted cycles (others fill the gap)

This is why:
  - GPU needs THOUSANDS of threads (not 4–8 like CPU)
  - Occupancy matters (more warps = more hiding capacity)
  - Register usage matters (more regs = fewer warps = less hiding)
  - Block size matters (more threads per block = more warps)
  - Memory access pattern matters (coalesced = fewer stalls to hide)
```

## 4. Thread Hierarchy

CUDA organizes threads in a 3-level hierarchy: **Grid → Block → Thread**, with warps as an implicit hardware grouping of 32 threads.

### 4.1 Grid, Block, Warp, Thread

```
Grid  (one per kernel launch)
├── Block (0,0)  ── 1024 threads max ── runs on one SM
│   ├── Warp 0   ── threads 0-31
│   ├── Warp 1   ── threads 32-63

*Thread blocks are dispatched to SMs. Multiple blocks can reside on one SM simultaneously (limited by registers, shared memory, and SM capacity). Source: NVIDIA*

**Built-in variables every kernel sees:**

| Variable | Type | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| `threadIdx.x/y/z` | `uint3` | Thread index within its block |
| `blockIdx.x/y/z` | `uint3` | Block index within the grid |

| `gridDim.x/y/z` | `uint3` | Grid dimensions (total blocks) |
| `warpSize` | `int` | Always 32 |

**Compute a global 1D thread ID:**

```cpp
int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
```

**Compute a global 2D thread ID:**

```cpp
int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
```

### 4.2 Constraints and Limits

```
Max threads per block:      1024
Max blocks per grid (x):    2,147,483,647
Max shared memory per block: 48 KB (default) → 228 KB (Hopper, if requested)
Max registers per thread:   255
Warp size:                  32  (always)
```

**Block size rule of thumb:**
- Must be a **multiple of 32** (warp size) — avoid partial warps
- 128, 256, or 512 are common choices
- Use `cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize()` to find the optimal size programmatically

### 4.3 Thread Block Clusters (Compute Capability 9.0+ / Hopper)

Hopper adds a new level between grid and block: **clusters** — a group of thread blocks that are guaranteed to run on neighbouring SMs simultaneously and can cooperate directly.

![Grid of clusters](../../../Assets/images/grid-of-clusters.png)

*Thread Block Clusters: multiple blocks scheduled simultaneously on the same GPC, sharing distributed shared memory. Source: NVIDIA*

**Before clusters** — blocks are independent:

```
Grid
├── Block 0 → SM 5   (wherever the scheduler puts it)
├── Block 1 → SM 71  (no control over placement)
├── Block 2 → SM 12
└── Block 3 → SM 99
Communication between blocks: global memory only (~400 cycles) ❌
Synchronization between blocks: impossible without kernel relaunch ❌
```

**With clusters** — blocks form coordinated teams:

```
Grid
├── Cluster 0
│   ├── Block 0 → SM 0  ← guaranteed on neighbouring SMs
│   ├── Block 1 → SM 1  ← can share memory directly
│   ├── Block 2 → SM 2  ← can synchronize
│   └── Block 3 → SM 3
├── Cluster 1
│   ├── Block 4 → SM 4
│   └── ...
```

**Three new capabilities:**

| Capability | Before clusters | With clusters |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Cross-block sync | Impossible | `cluster.sync()` barrier |
| Cross-block memory | Global memory only (~400 cycles) | **Distributed Shared Memory** (~30 cycles) |
| Co-scheduling | No guarantee | **Guaranteed on neighbouring SMs** |

#### Launching with Clusters

```cpp
// Hopper cluster launch (compute capability 9.0+)
__global__ void __cluster_dims__(2, 1, 1) my_kernel(float* data) {
    // This kernel runs with 2 blocks per cluster
    // Access cluster info:
    namespace cg = cooperative_groups;
    auto cluster = cg::this_cluster();

    unsigned int cluster_rank = cluster.block_rank();  // 0 or 1 in this cluster
    unsigned int cluster_size = cluster.num_blocks();   // 2

    // ... do work ...

    // Synchronize all blocks in the cluster
    cluster.sync();  // ← impossible without clusters!
}

// Alternative: runtime configuration
cudaLaunchConfig_t config = {};
config.gridDim = grid;
config.blockDim = block;

cudaLaunchAttribute attr;
attr.id = cudaLaunchAttributeClusterDimension;
attr.val.clusterDim = {2, 1, 1};   // 2 blocks per cluster
config.attrs = &attr;
config.numAttrs = 1;

cudaLaunchKernelEx(&config, my_kernel, args...);
```

#### Distributed Shared Memory (DSM)

This is the most powerful cluster feature. Blocks in a cluster can read/write each other's shared memory directly — no global memory round-trip.

```
Without DSM:
  Block 0 (SM 0):  shared mem = 228 KB   ← only Block 0 can access
  Block 1 (SM 1):  shared mem = 228 KB   ← only Block 1 can access
  Exchange data:   Block 0 → global mem → Block 1  (400+ cycles)

With DSM (cluster of 4 blocks):
  Block 0 (SM 0):  shared mem = 228 KB ─┐
  Block 1 (SM 1):  shared mem = 228 KB  ├─ ALL blocks see ALL 912 KB
  Block 2 (SM 2):  shared mem = 228 KB  │  via distributed shared memory
  Block 3 (SM 3):  shared mem = 228 KB ─┘
  Exchange data:   Block 0 → DSM → Block 1  (~30 cycles via SM-to-SM interconnect)
```

Effective shared memory per cluster: **4 × 228 KB = 912 KB** — enough to hold much larger tiles.

```cpp
__global__ void __cluster_dims__(4, 1, 1) dsm_kernel(float* data) {
    namespace cg = cooperative_groups;
    auto cluster = cg::this_cluster();

    __shared__ float tile[TILE_SIZE];

    // Each block loads its own tile
    load_tile(tile, data, blockIdx.x);

    cluster.sync();  // ensure all blocks have loaded

    // NOW: Block 0 can read Block 1's shared memory!
    unsigned int target_block = (cluster.block_rank() + 1) % cluster.num_blocks();
    float* remote_tile = cluster.map_shared_rank(tile, target_block);

    // remote_tile points to the OTHER block's shared memory
    // Access it at ~30 cycles (vs ~400 for global memory)
    float val = remote_tile[threadIdx.x];
}
```

#### DSM Latency Comparison

| Memory | Latency | Bandwidth | Scope |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Registers | 0 cycles | Unlimited | Per-thread |
| Shared memory (local) | ~5 cycles | ~128 B/cycle/SM | Per-block |
| **Distributed Shared Memory** | **~30 cycles** | **~32 B/cycle/SM** | **Per-cluster** |
| L2 cache | ~100 cycles | ~12 TB/s total | All SMs |
| Global (HBM) | ~400 cycles | ~3.35 TB/s | All SMs |

DSM is ~13× faster than global memory. Not as fast as local shared memory, but fast enough to enable cross-block cooperation without the global memory penalty.

#### Cluster Size Constraints

| Cluster size | Total shared mem | Use case |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 block (no cluster) | 228 KB | Default, backwards compatible |
| 2 blocks | 456 KB | Small cross-block cooperation |
| **4 blocks** | **912 KB** | **Sweet spot for attention tiling** |
| 8 blocks | 1824 KB | Large tiles, high SM occupancy cost |
| 16 blocks (max) | 3648 KB | Rare, requires many free SMs |

**Trade-off:** larger clusters reserve more SMs → fewer clusters can run simultaneously → potential occupancy loss. Typically 2–8 blocks per cluster is optimal.

### 4.4 Tiling — The Universal GPU Optimization

Tiling is the single most important optimization pattern in GPU computing. Every high-performance AI kernel (matmul, attention, convolution) is fundamentally a tiled algorithm.

**The core idea:** break a large problem into small tiles that fit in fast on-chip memory (shared memory / registers), compute on each tile, then move to the next.

```
Without tiling:                          With tiling:

  For each output element:                For each tile:
    Read inputs from global memory          Load tile into shared memory (1 read)
    Compute                                 Compute on tile (many reuses)
    Write output to global memory           Load next tile
                                            Write final output (1 write)
  Every element = separate DRAM access
  = SLOW                                  Each value loaded once, used many times
                                          = FAST
```

**Why it works — data reuse:**

```
Tiled matmul: C = A × B,  tile size T = 16

Without tiling:
  Each C[i,j] reads A[i, 0..N] and B[0..N, j] from DRAM
  Total reads: 2 × N per output element
  For N=4096: 8192 DRAM reads per element ❌

With tiling:
  Load 16×16 tile of A into shared memory → reused by 16 threads
  Load 16×16 tile of B into shared memory → reused by 16 threads
  Total DRAM reads per element: 2 × N/T = 2 × 4096/16 = 512
  That's 16× fewer DRAM reads ✓

  With T=32:  256× reduction
  With T=64:  4096× reduction (limited by shared memory size)
```

**Thread block = tile:**

```
One thread block handles one output tile.
Threads cooperatively load data into shared memory.
Each thread computes one element of the output tile.

Block (16×16 = 256 threads)
  ├── Threads 0–15:   load row 0 of tile A, row 0 of tile B
  ├── Threads 16–31:  load row 1...
  ├── ...
  └── __syncthreads() → all data in shared memory → compute
```

This is why block size, shared memory size, and tile size are so tightly coupled.

**Tiling hierarchy on modern GPUs:**

```
Level 0: Register tiling
  Each thread holds a small tile (e.g., 4×4) in registers
  Fastest: 0 cycles, unlimited bandwidth
  Used by: CUTLASS, cuBLAS inner loops

Level 1: Shared memory tiling (per block)
  Thread block loads tile into shared memory (48–228 KB)
  ~5 cycles, shared among threads in block
  Used by: standard tiled matmul, FlashAttention

Level 2: Distributed shared memory tiling (per cluster, Hopper)
  Cluster of blocks shares DSM (up to ~1 MB)
  ~30 cycles, shared among blocks in cluster
  Used by: Hopper-optimized FlashAttention, large attention tiles

Level 3: L2 cache tiling
  Multiple blocks' access patterns designed to hit L2 (40–50 MB)
  ~100 cycles, shared across all SMs
  Used by: persistent kernels, stream-K GEMM
```

### 4.5 Tiling for AI Workloads

Every AI operation maps to a tiled computation. Understanding this mapping is the bridge from CUDA programming to AI accelerator design.

#### Matrix Multiply (GEMM) — The Foundation

```
C[M×N] = A[M×K] × B[K×N]

Tile: each block computes a TILE_M × TILE_N output tile

  ┌────────────────────┐         ┌────────────────────┐
  │ A                  │         │ B                  │
  │ ┌──────┐           │         │ ┌──────┐           │
  │ │Tile A│→ load to  │         │ │Tile B│→ load to  │
  │ │TILE_M│  shared   │         │ │TILE_K│  shared   │
  │ │×     │  memory   │         │ │×     │  memory   │
  │ │TILE_K│           │         │ │TILE_N│           │
  │ └──────┘           │         │ └──────┘           │
  └────────────────────┘         └────────────────────┘

  Output: C[TILE_M × TILE_N] = Σ_k (TileA × TileB)

  Iterate over K dimension in chunks of TILE_K.
  Each iteration: 1 load from DRAM, many multiplies from shared memory.
```

**This is exactly what cuBLAS and CUTLASS do** — with additional optimizations: double-buffering (load next tile while computing current), register tiling (each thread handles a 4×4 sub-tile), and Tensor Core wmma instructions.

#### Attention — FlashAttention Tiling

Attention is the bottleneck of every transformer. FlashAttention solves it with tiling:

```
Standard attention (materializes full matrix):

  S = Q × K^T           (seq × seq matrix — huge!)
  P = softmax(S)         (still seq × seq)
  O = P × V              (output)

  Memory: O(seq²) — for seq=4096, that's 64 MB in FP16
  Problem: doesn't fit in shared memory, tons of DRAM traffic

FlashAttention (tiled, never materializes full matrix):

  For each Q tile (TILE_Q rows of Q):
    For each K/V tile (TILE_KV columns of K, rows of V):
      Load Q tile into shared memory
      Load K tile into shared memory
      S_tile = Q_tile × K_tile^T           (small: TILE_Q × TILE_KV)
      P_tile = online_softmax(S_tile)       (computed incrementally!)
      Load V tile into shared memory
      O_tile += P_tile × V_tile            (accumulate in registers)
    Write O_tile to global memory

  Memory: O(seq) — only tiles in shared memory at any time
  DRAM traffic: ~4× less than standard attention
```

```
FlashAttention data flow through memory:

  Global memory (HBM)
        │
        ├── Load Q tile ──────►  Shared memory
        ├── Load K tile ──────►  Shared memory
        │                            │
        │                       Compute S = Q × K^T
        │                       (stays in registers)
        │                            │
        │                       Compute softmax(S)
        │                       (online, incremental)
        │                            │
        ├── Load V tile ──────►  Shared memory
        │                            │
        │                       Compute O += P × V
        │                       (accumulate in registers)
        │                            │
        └── Write O tile ◄──── Registers
                                (only final output touches DRAM)
```

**Why FlashAttention is so important on Jetson:** Jetson's 51 GB/s bandwidth is the bottleneck. FlashAttention reduces DRAM traffic by ~4× for attention, which directly translates to ~4× faster attention.

#### Convolution — im2col + GEMM Tiling

CNNs use the same tiling through a clever trick: im2col converts convolution into matrix multiplication, then cuBLAS tiled GEMM handles it:

```
Input image: [batch × channels × height × width]
Kernel: [out_channels × in_channels × kH × kW]

im2col: unfold image patches into a matrix
  Each patch (kH × kW × channels) becomes one column
  Result: [patch_size × num_patches] matrix

Now: convolution = matrix multiply (patches × kernels)
  → cuBLAS tiled GEMM → Tensor Cores → maximum throughput
```

#### Tensor Parallelism — Tiling Across GPUs

For models too large for one GPU (or one Jetson), tensor parallelism splits weight matrices across devices:

```
Single GPU:
  Y = X × W                    (W is too large for one GPU)

Tensor parallel (4 GPUs):
  W split column-wise: W = [W₀ | W₁ | W₂ | W₃]

  GPU 0: Y₀ = X × W₀
  GPU 1: Y₁ = X × W₁          ← each GPU computes partial output
  GPU 2: Y₂ = X × W₂
  GPU 3: Y₃ = X × W₃

  All-gather: Y = [Y₀ | Y₁ | Y₂ | Y₃]   ← combine over NVLink/PCIe
```

On Jetson, tensor parallelism isn't applicable (single GPU), but the concept maps directly to the GPU+DLA split:

```
Jetson "parallelism":
  DLA: runs conv/pool layers (subset of model)
  GPU: runs attention/custom layers

  Same output buffer shared via unified memory — zero-copy handoff
  Both engines consume bandwidth from the same 51 GB/s pipe
```

#### How Clusters Enable Bigger Attention Tiles (Hopper)

Standard FlashAttention is limited by one block's shared memory (~228 KB). With clusters:

```
Standard (1 block, 228 KB shared mem):
  Q tile: 64 tokens × 128 dims × 2 bytes = 16 KB
  K tile: 64 tokens × 128 dims × 2 bytes = 16 KB
  V tile: 64 tokens × 128 dims × 2 bytes = 16 KB
  Workspace: ~50 KB
  Total: ~98 KB  (fits in 228 KB ✓)

Cluster of 4 blocks (912 KB distributed shared mem):
  Q tile: 256 tokens × 128 dims × 2 bytes = 64 KB
  K tile: 256 tokens × 128 dims × 2 bytes = 64 KB
  V tile: 256 tokens × 128 dims × 2 bytes = 64 KB
  Workspace: ~200 KB
  Total: ~392 KB  (needs cluster DSM ✓)

  Bigger tiles = more data reuse = fewer DRAM reads = faster
  4× larger tiles → up to 4× less memory traffic
```

This is why Hopper FlashAttention-3 is significantly faster than Ampere FlashAttention-2 — it's not just faster Tensor Cores, it's **bigger tiles via clusters**.

### 4.6 The Tiling Mental Model

```
Level              Unit            Fast memory        Tile size
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thread             registers       registers          2×2 – 8×8
Warp               warp shuffles   register file      32-wide
Block              thread block    shared memory      16×16 – 64×64
Cluster (Hopper)   block cluster   distributed SM     64×64 – 256×256
SM array           all SMs         L2 cache           entire matrix dimension
Multi-GPU          GPUs            NVLink/PCIe        tensor parallel split

Each level follows the same principle:
  1. Load data into the fast memory at this level
  2. Reuse it as many times as possible
  3. Only go to the next (slower) level when this level is exhausted
```

### 4.7 Inside One SM — Tiled Matmul Step by Step

Everything above is theory. This section zooms into **what actually happens inside a single SM** during a tiled matrix multiplication — cycle by cycle, warp by warp.

**Setup:** one thread block computing a 128×128 output tile of C = A × B. K dimension processed in chunks of 32. Block has 256 threads = 8 warps.

#### Step 1: Block Arrives at the SM

The hardware scheduler assigns the block to an SM. The SM allocates:

```
Resources locked for this block:
  Registers:     256 threads × 32 regs × 4 bytes = 32 KB  (from 256 KB file)
  Shared memory: 128×32 + 32×128 = 8K elements × 2 bytes = 16 KB  (from 48 KB)
  Warp slots:    8 warps                                    (from 48 max)

Remaining SM capacity: other blocks can co-reside if resources allow
```

#### Step 2: Threads Grouped into Warps

```
256 threads → 8 warps:
  Warp 0: threads   0– 31    Warp 4: threads 128–159
  Warp 1: threads  32– 63    Warp 5: threads 160–191
  Warp 2: threads  64– 95    Warp 6: threads 192–223
  Warp 3: threads  96–127    Warp 7: threads 224–255

4 warp schedulers manage these 8 warps.
Each cycle, each scheduler picks one ready warp → 4 warps active per cycle.
```

#### Step 3: Cooperative Tile Loading

Every thread participates in loading the tile — no single thread does all the work:

```
A tile [128×32] = 4,096 elements   →  256 threads each load 16 elements
B tile [32×128] = 4,096 elements   →  256 threads each load 16 elements

Memory access pattern (coalesced):
  Warp 0: loads A[row 0..3,  col 0..31]   32 threads × 4 rows = 128 bytes/thread
  Warp 1: loads A[row 4..7,  col 0..31]
  ...
  Warp 4: loads B[row 0..3,  col 0..127]  (same pattern for B)
  ...

All loads are coalesced: consecutive threads access consecutive addresses.
32 threads × 4 bytes = 128 bytes → one memory transaction.
```

**Why this is fast:** each value is loaded from DRAM once (slow, ~300 cycles), then read from shared memory many times (fast, ~5 cycles). For a 128×128 tile with K=32: each A element is reused 128 times, each B element is reused 128 times.

#### Step 4: Synchronization Barrier

```cpp
__syncthreads();  // ALL 256 threads must reach here before any proceed
```

Without this barrier: some warps start computing before the tile is fully loaded → wrong results. The barrier ensures all 8,192 elements are in shared memory before math begins.

#### Step 5: Each Warp Gets a Subtile

The 128×128 output tile is divided among warps:

```
Output tile [128×128]:
  ┌────────┬────────┐
  │ Warp 0 │ Warp 1 │     Each warp computes a 64×32 subtile
  │ 64×32  │ 64×32  │     (or similar partitioning)
  ├────────┼────────┤
  │ Warp 2 │ Warp 3 │     Within each warp:
  │ 64×32  │ 64×32  │       each thread handles a 4×4 sub-subtile
  ├────────┼────────┤       in REGISTERS (not shared memory)
  │ Warp 4 │ Warp 5 │
  ├────────┼────────┤
  │ Warp 6 │ Warp 7 │
  └────────┴────────┘
```

#### Step 6A: CUDA Core Execution

Each thread performs scalar FMA (fused multiply-add) operations:

```
Thread's inner loop (K chunk = 32):
  for k = 0 to 31:
    acc[0][0] += shared_A[my_row + 0][k] * shared_B[k][my_col + 0]
    acc[0][1] += shared_A[my_row + 0][k] * shared_B[k][my_col + 1]
    acc[1][0] += shared_A[my_row + 1][k] * shared_B[k][my_col + 0]
    acc[1][1] += shared_A[my_row + 1][k] * shared_B[k][my_col + 1]

  acc[4][4] in registers = 16 accumulators per thread
  32 K iterations × 16 FMAs = 512 FMA ops per thread per K chunk
  256 threads × 512 = 131,072 FMAs per block per K chunk
```

All accumulators live in **registers** — the fastest storage. No DRAM writes until the entire K dimension is processed.

#### Step 6B: Tensor Core Execution

Instead of scalar FMAs, a warp issues matrix-multiply-accumulate (MMA) instructions:

```
Tensor Core MMA instruction:
  D[16×8] = A[16×8] × B[8×8] + C[16×8]

  One instruction = 16 × 8 × 8 = 1,024 multiply-adds
  vs CUDA core: 1 FMA per instruction

Each warp issues multiple MMA instructions to cover its subtile:
  64×32 warp tile / 16×8 MMA tile = 16 MMA instructions per K step

Throughput: 16 × 1,024 = 16,384 ops per warp per K step
  vs CUDA cores: 32 threads × 1 = 32 ops per cycle
  → Tensor Cores are ~500× higher throughput per instruction
```

#### Step 7: Advance Through K Dimension

After finishing one K chunk (32 elements):

```
K = 0..31:    load A[128×32], B[32×128] → compute → accumulate in registers
K = 32..63:   load A[128×32], B[32×128] → compute → add to SAME registers
K = 64..95:   load A[128×32], B[32×128] → compute → add to SAME registers
...
K = N-32..N:  final chunk → registers hold complete C[128×128]

Registers accumulate: C[i,j] = Σ_k A[i,k] × B[k,j]
                       built up across all K chunks
```

#### Step 8: Final Store

```
Registers → global memory (DRAM)

256 threads cooperatively write 128×128 = 16,384 elements to C.
Each thread writes its 4×4 subtile (16 elements).
Writes are coalesced: consecutive threads write consecutive addresses.
```

#### What Happens Every Cycle (Zoomed In)

```
Clock cycle N:
  Scheduler 0: Warp 2 → issues LOAD from shared memory
  Scheduler 1: Warp 5 → issues FMA (or Tensor Core MMA)
  Scheduler 2: Warp 0 → issues LOAD from global memory (prefetch next tile)
  Scheduler 3: Warp 7 → stalled (waiting for global load) → SKIP

Clock cycle N+1:
  Scheduler 0: Warp 2 → issues FMA (data arrived from shared mem)
  Scheduler 1: Warp 5 → issues FMA (next accumulation)
  Scheduler 2: Warp 1 → issues LOAD from shared memory
  Scheduler 3: Warp 3 → issues FMA

Latency hiding: while Warp 7 waits for DRAM (300 cycles),
  warps 0–6 execute ~300 × 4 = 1,200 instructions across the 4 schedulers.
  SM never idles.
```

#### Double Buffering — Overlap Load and Compute

Elite kernels (cuBLAS, CUTLASS) load the **next** tile while computing the **current** tile:

```
Time:   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────►

Load:   [Tile 0 load]  [Tile 1 load]  [Tile 2 load]  [Tile 3 load]
                    ↘              ↘              ↘
Compute:           [Tile 0 compute][Tile 1 compute][Tile 2 compute]

Without double buffering:
  [Load 0][Compute 0][Load 1][Compute 1][Load 2][Compute 2]
  ← gaps where SM waits for memory

With double buffering:
  Load and compute overlap → nearly 100% SM utilization
```

Requires two shared memory buffers (one being loaded, one being computed on). Uses 2× shared memory but hides all load latency.

#### CUTLASS Tiling Hierarchy

Production GEMM libraries organize tiles in nested levels:

```
Threadblock tile [128×128×32]       ← one thread block's output + K chunk
  └── Warp tile [64×64]            ← one warp's output portion
        └── MMA tile [16×8×8]      ← one Tensor Core instruction
              └── Thread tile [4×4] ← one thread's register accumulators

Each level maps to a different memory/compute resource:
  Threadblock tile → shared memory (load from DRAM)
  Warp tile        → register file (computed in registers)
  MMA tile         → Tensor Core hardware instruction
  Thread tile      → individual thread's registers
```

This nested structure is why CUTLASS code looks complex — but it's just the same tiling idea applied recursively at every level of the hardware hierarchy.

#### Real Bottlenecks in Tiled Matmul

| Bottleneck | Cause | Symptom | Fix |
|-----------|-------|---------|-----|
| Bank conflicts | Multiple threads hit same shared memory bank | Shared mem throughput drops 2–32× | Pad: `__shared__ float A[128][33]` (not 32) |
| Register pressure | Too many accumulators → spill to local memory | `ptxas` reports spills | Reduce thread tile size (4×4 → 2×2) |
| Low occupancy | Large shared mem + many registers → few blocks per SM | SM utilization < 50% | Reduce tile size or shared mem usage |
| Uncoalesced global loads | Threads access non-contiguous DRAM addresses | Memory throughput < 50% peak | Ensure thread N loads address N (stride-1) |
| Shared memory bottleneck | Compute is faster than shared memory can deliver data | Compute units idle | Use register tiling to reuse data from shared mem |

## 5. Writing Kernels

### 5.1 Function Qualifiers

```cpp
// Runs on GPU, called from CPU (kernel)
__global__ void my_kernel(float* a, float* b, float* c, int N);

// Runs on GPU, called from GPU only
__device__ float helper(float x);

// Runs on CPU (default)
void host_function();

// Compiles for both CPU and GPU
__host__ __device__ float clamp(float x, float lo, float hi) {
    return x < lo ? lo : (x > hi ? hi : x);
}
```

### 5.2 Launching a Kernel

```cpp
// Syntax: kernel<<<grid_dim, block_dim, shared_mem_bytes, stream>>>(args)

int N = 1 << 20;   // 1M elements
int block_size = 256;
int grid_size = (N + block_size - 1) / block_size;  // ceil division

saxpy<<<grid_size, block_size>>>(a, b, c, N);

// 2D launch for matrix ops
dim3 block(16, 16);         // 256 threads per block
dim3 grid((W + 15) / 16, (H + 15) / 16);

matmul<<<grid, block>>>(A, B, C, M, N, K);
```

### 5.3 Complete SAXPY Example

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cstdio>

// Kernel: c[i] = alpha * a[i] + b[i]
__global__ void saxpy(float alpha, const float* a, const float* b, float* c, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N)   // bounds check — last block may be partial
        c[i] = alpha * a[i] + b[i];
}

int main() {
    const int N = 1 << 20;
    const size_t bytes = N * sizeof(float);

    // Allocate host memory
    float *h_a = new float[N], *h_b = new float[N], *h_c = new float[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { h_a[i] = 1.0f; h_b[i] = 2.0f; }

    // Allocate device memory
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
    cudaMalloc(&d_a, bytes);
    cudaMalloc(&d_b, bytes);
    cudaMalloc(&d_c, bytes);

    // Copy H → D
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch
    int block = 256;
    int grid  = (N + block - 1) / block;
    saxpy<<<grid, block>>>(2.0f, d_a, d_b, d_c, N);

    // Copy D → H
    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Verify
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (h_c[i] != 4.0f) { printf("WRONG at %d\n", i); break; }
    }
    printf("OK: c[0] = %.1f\n", h_c[0]);   // expected: 4.0

    cudaFree(d_a); cudaFree(d_b); cudaFree(d_c);
    delete[] h_a; delete[] h_b; delete[] h_c;
}
```

### 5.4 Error Checking

```cpp
// Macro to check any CUDA call
#define CUDA_CHECK(call) do {                                    \
    cudaError_t err = (call);                                    \
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                    \
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d — %s\n",           \
                __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));    \
        exit(1);                                                 \
    }                                                            \
} while(0)

// Usage
CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_a, bytes));
CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice));

// Check kernel errors (kernels don't return error codes)
my_kernel<<<grid, block>>>(args);
CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetLastError());       // check launch error
CUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());  // wait + check execution error
```

> **Always check errors in development.** Suppress `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` in production (it blocks the CPU) but keep `cudaGetLastError()`.

## 6. Memory Spaces

Every variable in CUDA lives in a specific memory space. Understanding this is the most important skill for optimization.

![CUDA Memory Hierarchy](../../../Assets/images/cuda-memory-hierarchy.png)

*Source: NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide*

### 6.1 Memory Space Summary

| Memory | Location | Scope | Lifetime | Latency | Bandwidth | Size |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|------|
| **Register** | On-chip (SM) | 1 thread | Kernel | 0 cycles | N/A | 256 KB/SM |
| **Local** | Off-chip (DRAM) | 1 thread | Kernel | ~600 cycles | ~same as global | Per thread |
| **Shared** | On-chip (SM) | All threads in block | Kernel | ~20–40 cycles | ~19 TB/s (H100) | Up to 228 KB/SM |
| **L1 cache** | On-chip (SM) | 1 SM | Automatic | ~20–40 cycles | Same as shared | Part of unified cache |
| **L2 cache** | On-chip (GPU) | All SMs | Automatic | ~200 cycles | ~TB/s | 50 MB (H100) |
| **Global** | Off-chip (HBM) | All threads | Application | ~600 cycles | ~3.35 TB/s (H100) | ~80 GB |
| **Constant** | Off-chip (cached) | All threads (read-only) | Application | ~20 cycles (cached) | — | 64 KB |
| **Texture** | Off-chip (cached) | All threads (read-only) | Application | ~20 cycles (cached) | — | Up to 2D |

### 6.2 Register and Local Memory

```cpp
__global__ void kernel() {
    int x = 5;        // register (fast, private per thread)
    float arr[10];    // may spill to local memory if too large
    // local memory = per-thread DRAM — very slow, avoid large on-stack arrays
}
```

**Register spilling:** If a thread uses too many registers, the compiler stores the overflow in slow local memory (off-chip DRAM). Detect with `nvcc --ptxas-options=-v`.

### 6.3 Shared Memory

Shared memory is the most important optimization tool in CUDA. All threads in a block share it, it's on-chip, and it's ~30× faster than global memory.

```cpp
__global__ void use_shared(float* in, float* out, int N) {
    __shared__ float tile[256];   // allocated at compile time

    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    int gid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    // Load from global into shared
    tile[tid] = (gid < N) ? in[gid] : 0.0f;
    __syncthreads();   // ← CRITICAL: all threads must finish loading

    // Now process from shared (fast)
    tile[tid] = tile[tid] * 2.0f;
    __syncthreads();

    // Write back to global
    if (gid < N) out[gid] = tile[tid];
}
```

**Dynamic shared memory** (size determined at launch):

```cpp
__global__ void kernel(float* data) {
    extern __shared__ float smem[];   // size determined at launch
    smem[threadIdx.x] = data[...];
    // ...
}

// Launch: third argument = shared memory bytes
kernel<<<grid, block, 256 * sizeof(float)>>>(data);
```

**Request more than 48 KB per block:**

```cpp
// Required for > 48 KB shared memory (Ampere+)
cudaFuncSetAttribute(my_kernel,
    cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize,
    96 * 1024);  // 96 KB

my_kernel<<<grid, block, 96 * 1024>>>(args);
```

### 6.4 Global Memory Allocation

```cpp
float *d_data;
cudaMalloc(&d_data, N * sizeof(float));   // allocate
cudaFree(d_data);                          // free

// Transfers
cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);   // H→D
cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);   // D→H
cudaMemcpy(d_dst, d_src,   bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice); // D→D

// Zero-initialize
cudaMemset(d_data, 0, bytes);
```

**Pinned (page-locked) host memory** — faster H↔D transfers:

```cpp
float *h_data;
cudaMallocHost(&h_data, bytes);   // allocate pinned host memory
// OR: cudaHostAlloc(&h_data, bytes, cudaHostAllocDefault);

// Use exactly like regular memory
// Transfer speed: ~2× faster than pageable memory

cudaFreeHost(h_data);
```

**Unified Memory** — single pointer accessible from both CPU and GPU:

```cpp
float *data;
cudaMallocManaged(&data, bytes);   // managed allocation

// Use on CPU
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) data[i] = 1.0f;

// Use on GPU — CUDA runtime migrates pages automatically
kernel<<<grid, block>>>(data, N);
cudaDeviceSynchronize();

// Use on CPU again — migrates back
printf("%f\n", data[0]);

cudaFree(data);
```

### 6.5 Constant Memory

For read-only data shared by all threads — cached with broadcast (one read serves all 32 threads in a warp):

```cpp
__constant__ float weights[1024];

__global__ void apply_weights(float* data, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) data[i] *= weights[i % 1024];   // all threads read same value: broadcast
}

// Host-side: copy to constant memory
cudaMemcpyToSymbol(weights, h_weights, 1024 * sizeof(float));
```

---

## 7. Warp Execution and SIMT

### 7.1 SIMT — Single Instruction, Multiple Threads

A warp is 32 threads. The SM issues **one instruction** to all 32 lanes simultaneously. This is hardware-level SIMD, but each thread has its own registers and can follow its own control flow.

![Active warp lanes](../../../Assets/images/active-warp-lanes.png)

*Active vs inactive lanes in a warp. Inactive lanes (diverged threads) are masked off — they consume time but produce no output. Source: NVIDIA*

### 7.2 Warp Divergence

When threads in a warp take **different branches**, they execute both paths serially — inactive lanes are masked off.

```cpp
__global__ void divergent(float* data, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i % 2 == 0)    // ← half the warp goes here
        data[i] *= 2.0f;
    else               // ← other half goes here (serialized!)
        data[i] += 1.0f;
}

// Result: warp takes TWO passes — both branches run, half masked each time
// 2× slower than a non-divergent version
```

**How the GPU actually handles this — predication and `SEL`:**

CUDA hardware can convert short branches into **predicated instructions**. Instead of branching, the GPU executes both paths and uses a `SEL` (select) instruction to pick the correct result. This is the hardware equivalent of branchless selection — and the compiler does it automatically for simple cases.

**Approach 1 — Ternary operator (recommended):**

This *looks* like branching code, but the compiler generates branchless SASS assembly because the operations are trivial:

```cpp
__global__ void branchless_ternary(float* data, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        float val  = data[i];
        float even = val * 2.0f;      // compute BOTH results
        float odd  = val + 1.0f;
        data[i] = (i % 2 == 0) ? even : odd;  // compiler emits SEL, not branch
    }
}
```

The NVCC compiler sees that both paths are cheap (one multiply, one add) and emits a predicated `SEL` instruction instead of a conditional jump. All 32 threads in the warp execute in lockstep — no divergence.

**Approach 2 — Arithmetic select (manual branchless):**

If you want to guarantee branchless execution regardless of compiler decisions:

```cpp
__global__ void branchless_arithmetic(float* data, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        float val  = data[i];
        float even = val * 2.0f;
        float odd  = val + 1.0f;
        int is_even = 1 - (i & 1);     // 1 if even, 0 if odd — no branch
        data[i] = is_even * even + (1 - is_even) * odd;  // pure arithmetic
    }
}
```

Both values are computed, then blended with integer masks — zero branches at any level.

**How CUDA differs from CPU here:**

| | CPU (x86 SIMD) | GPU (CUDA) |
|---|---|---|
| Default branch handling | Branch instruction + branch predictor | **Automatic predication** for short branches |
| Making it branchless | Requires manual SIMD blend intrinsics (`_mm256_blendv_ps`) | Compiler does it automatically for ternary/simple if |
| When divergence hurts | Branch misprediction penalty (~15 cycles) | Warp serialization (executes both paths, 2× time) |
| Branchless payoff | Always faster than misprediction | Only faster when both paths are cheap |

**When NOT to use branchless:**

If the two paths are expensive (e.g., complex loops, function calls), computing both paths wastes work. Better to let the warp diverge and only execute the needed path:

```cpp
// DON'T make this branchless — computing heavy_func for all threads wastes cycles
if (condition)
    result = heavy_function_A(x);   // 100+ instructions
else
    result = heavy_function_B(x);   // 100+ instructions

// Divergence serializes (2× time) but only does NEEDED work
// Branchless would do ALL work for ALL threads (2× work × all threads)
```

**Rule of thumb:** branchless for single-instruction operations (mul, add, max, min). Let the compiler handle ternary operators. Use arithmetic select only if profiling shows the compiler didn't predicate.

**Verify with SASS inspection:**

```bash
# Compile to SASS and check for branch vs SEL instructions
nvcc -arch=sm_87 -Xptxas=-v --ptx my_kernel.cu
cuobjdump --dump-sass my_kernel.o | grep -E "BRA|SEL|@P"
# SEL = select (branchless)  ✓
# BRA = branch (divergent)   ✗
# @P = predicated instruction ✓
```

**When divergence is unavoidable:** `if (i < N)` bounds checks diverge only the last partial warp — acceptable.

### 7.3 Occupancy — Hiding Latency

The GPU hides memory latency by switching to other **resident warps** while one warp waits. More resident warps = more latency hiding = higher throughput.

```
SM capacity: 2048 resident threads (H100) = 64 warps
If block size = 256 → 8 warps/block → 8 blocks resident per SM
If block size = 32  → 1 warp/block  → 64 blocks resident per SM (but tiny blocks waste overhead)
If block size = 1024 → 32 warps/block → 2 blocks = 64 warps = 100% occupancy
```

**Occupancy is limited by:**
1. **Registers per thread** — more registers = fewer threads fit
2. **Shared memory per block** — more shared mem = fewer blocks fit
3. **Max threads per SM** — hard limit

**Find optimal config programmatically:**

```cpp
int block_size, min_grid;
cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize(&min_grid, &block_size, my_kernel, 0, 0);
printf("Optimal block size: %d\n", block_size);

// Query actual occupancy
int active_blocks;
cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor(&active_blocks, my_kernel, block_size, 0);
float occupancy = (active_blocks * block_size) / (float)props.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor;
printf("Occupancy: %.1f%%\n", occupancy * 100);
```

---

## 8. Memory Coalescing

Global memory is accessed in **128-byte cache line** chunks. If 32 threads in a warp access 32 contiguous floats (128 bytes), that's **one memory transaction**. If they access scattered addresses, that's up to **32 transactions** — 32× slower.

![Coalesced memory access](../../../Assets/images/coalesced-memory.png)

*32 threads access 32 consecutive 4-byte floats → 1 transaction (128 bytes). Source: NVIDIA*

![Uncoalesced memory access](../../../Assets/images/uncoalesced-memory.png)

*Scattered accesses → multiple transactions, wasted bandwidth. Source: NVIDIA*

**Coalesced (good):**

```cpp
// Thread i accesses a[i] — consecutive, perfectly coalesced
__global__ void coalesced(float* a, float* b, float* c, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
}
```

**Strided (bad):**

```cpp
// Thread i accesses a[i * stride] — stride = 4 means 1/4 cache lines used
__global__ void strided(float* a, float* b, float* c, int stride, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i * stride < N) c[i] = a[i * stride] + b[i * stride];
}
// Each 128-byte load fetches 32 floats, but only uses 1 → 97% wasted bandwidth
```

**Fix strided access with transpose or SoA layout (see AoS vs SoA in SIMD guide).**

---

## 9. Shared Memory and Bank Conflicts

Shared memory is divided into **32 banks**, each 4 bytes wide. Bank `k` holds addresses `k`, `k+32`, `k+64`, etc.

If multiple threads in a warp access **different addresses in the same bank**, that's a **bank conflict** — serialized. If all threads access the **same address** in one bank, it's a **broadcast** — no conflict.

![Shared memory bank conflicts](../../../Assets/images/shared-mem-bank-conflicts.png)

*Source: NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide*

```cpp
// No conflict: thread i accesses bank i
__shared__ float smem[32];
float val = smem[threadIdx.x];          // OK: thread 0→bank 0, thread 1→bank 1, ...

// 2-way bank conflict: thread 0 and 16 both access bank 0
float val = smem[threadIdx.x * 2];     // BAD: stride 2 → 2-way conflict

// Fix: pad the array
__shared__ float smem[32 + 1];         // +1 pad shifts all addresses
float val = smem[threadIdx.x * 2];     // Now stride-2 is conflict-free

// 32-way conflict (broadcast): all threads read the same element
float val = smem[0];                   // OK — hardware broadcasts, no conflict
```

**Matrix transpose (classic bank conflict example):**

```cpp
#define TILE 32

__global__ void transpose(float* out, const float* in, int width, int height) {
    __shared__ float tile[TILE][TILE + 1];   // +1 padding avoids conflicts

    int x = blockIdx.x * TILE + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * TILE + threadIdx.y;

    if (x < width && y < height)
        tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = in[y * width + x];   // coalesced read

    __syncthreads();

    x = blockIdx.y * TILE + threadIdx.x;
    y = blockIdx.x * TILE + threadIdx.y;

    if (x < height && y < width)
        out[y * height + x] = tile[threadIdx.x][threadIdx.y]; // coalesced write
}
```

---

## 10. Synchronization

### 10.1 Within a Block

```cpp
__syncthreads();          // barrier: all threads in block reach this before any continues
__syncwarp();             // barrier: all threads in a warp (lighter, within one warp)
__syncwarp(mask);         // barrier for a subset of warp lanes (mask = bitfield)
```

> **`__syncthreads()` in conditional code is undefined behavior** if not all threads reach it:
> ```cpp
> // WRONG: some threads may not reach __syncthreads()
> if (threadIdx.x < 16) {
>     smem[threadIdx.x] = data[threadIdx.x];
>     __syncthreads();   // ← UB: threads 16-31 never reach this
> }
>
> // CORRECT: syncthreads outside the conditional
> smem[threadIdx.x] = (threadIdx.x < 16) ? data[threadIdx.x] : 0;
> __syncthreads();       // all threads hit this
> ```

### 10.2 Atomic Operations

```cpp
// Atomic add (global or shared memory)
atomicAdd(&counter, 1);
atomicAdd(&shared_sum, val);

// Other atomics
atomicSub(&counter, 1);
atomicMax(&max_val, val);
atomicMin(&min_val, val);
atomicCAS(&lock, 0, 1);      // compare-and-swap: if *lock==0, set to 1, return old

// Warp-level reduction (compute capability 8.0+)
float warp_sum = __reduce_add_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, val);
float warp_max = __reduce_max_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, val);
```

### 10.3 Warp Shuffle — Pass Data Between Threads Without Shared Memory

```cpp
// Each thread gets the value from thread src_lane in the same warp
float val = __shfl_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, local_val, src_lane);

// Shift: thread i receives from thread i+delta
float val = __shfl_down_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, local_val, delta);
float val = __shfl_up_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, local_val, delta);

// XOR exchange (butterfly for reductions)
float val = __shfl_xor_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, local_val, mask);

// Warp reduction using shuffles (no shared memory, no sync needed)
__device__ float warp_reduce_sum(float val) {
    for (int offset = warpSize / 2; offset > 0; offset >>= 1)
        val += __shfl_down_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, val, offset);
    return val;   // thread 0 holds the sum
}
```

---

## 11. Streams and Asynchronous Execution

Streams allow overlapping GPU computation with host execution and with data transfers.

```cpp
cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

// Overlapping compute and copy
cudaMemcpyAsync(d_a, h_a, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream1);
kernel<<<grid, block, 0, stream1>>>(d_a, d_out, N);
cudaMemcpyAsync(h_out, d_out, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream1);

// Different work on stream2, runs concurrently with stream1
other_kernel<<<grid, block, 0, stream2>>>(d_b, d_out2, N);

// Synchronize
cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);   // wait for stream1
cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);   // wait for stream2

cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
```

**Stream timeline (overlapping copy + compute):**

```
Stream 1:  [copy H→D] [kernel] [copy D→H]
Stream 2:             [copy H→D] [kernel] [copy D→H]
           ─────────────────────────────────────────► time
```

**Events for precise timing and cross-stream sync:**

```cpp
cudaEvent_t start, stop;
cudaEventCreate(&start);
cudaEventCreate(&stop);

cudaEventRecord(start, stream1);
kernel<<<grid, block, 0, stream1>>>(args);
cudaEventRecord(stop, stream1);

cudaEventSynchronize(stop);
float ms;
cudaEventElapsedTime(&ms, start, stop);
printf("Kernel time: %.3f ms\n", ms);

cudaEventDestroy(start);
cudaEventDestroy(stop);
```

---

## 12. CUDA Graphs

For workloads that repeat the same sequence of kernels and transfers, CUDA graphs eliminate per-launch CPU overhead by capturing and replaying the entire execution graph.

```cpp
// Step 1: capture a sequence of operations
cudaGraph_t graph;
cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);

kernel_a<<<grid, block, 0, stream>>>(d_a, N);
kernel_b<<<grid, block, 0, stream>>>(d_a, d_b, N);
cudaMemcpyAsync(h_out, d_b, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream);

cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &graph);

// Step 2: instantiate (compile the graph)
cudaGraphExec_t graph_exec;
cudaGraphInstantiate(&graph_exec, graph, nullptr, nullptr, 0);

// Step 3: launch repeatedly (minimal CPU overhead)
for (int iter = 0; iter < 1000; iter++) {
    cudaGraphLaunch(graph_exec, stream);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);
}

// Cleanup
cudaGraphExecDestroy(graph_exec);
cudaGraphDestroy(graph);
```

**When to use graphs:**
- Same kernel sequence repeated many times (training loops, inference batches)
- Many small kernels where launch overhead dominates
- CPU overhead reduction from ~5 µs/launch → ~1 µs/graph replay

## 13. Parallel Reduction — Complete Example

Reduction is the canonical shared memory + sync pattern.

```cpp
// Parallel sum reduction — each block reduces its chunk to one value
__global__ void reduce_sum(const float* in, float* partial, int N) {
    extern __shared__ float smem[];

    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    int gid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * 2 + threadIdx.x;  // × 2: each thread loads 2

    // Load two elements per thread
    float val = 0.0f;
    if (gid < N)         val += in[gid];
    if (gid + blockDim.x < N) val += in[gid + blockDim.x];
    smem[tid] = val;
    __syncthreads();

    // Tree reduction in shared memory
    for (int stride = blockDim.x / 2; stride > 32; stride >>= 1) {
        if (tid < stride)
            smem[tid] += smem[tid + stride];
        __syncthreads();
    }

    // Final warp reduction (no sync needed within a warp)
    if (tid < 32) {
        volatile float* s = smem;   // volatile prevents compiler from caching
        s[tid] += s[tid + 32];
        s[tid] += s[tid + 16];
        s[tid] += s[tid + 8];
        s[tid] += s[tid + 4];
        s[tid] += s[tid + 2];
        s[tid] += s[tid + 1];
    }

    // Thread 0 writes this block's partial sum
    if (tid == 0) partial[blockIdx.x] = smem[0];
}

// Host: launch reduce_sum, then sum the partial results
float gpu_sum(const float* d_in, int N) {
    int block = 256;
    int grid  = (N + block * 2 - 1) / (block * 2);

    float *d_partial;
    cudaMalloc(&d_partial, grid * sizeof(float));

    reduce_sum<<<grid, block, block * sizeof(float)>>>(d_in, d_partial, N);

    // Recursively reduce if needed, or just copy partial to host and sum there
    std::vector<float> h_partial(grid);
    cudaMemcpy(h_partial.data(), d_partial, grid * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaFree(d_partial);

    return std::accumulate(h_partial.begin(), h_partial.end(), 0.0f);
}
```

## 14. Tiled Matrix Multiply — Shared Memory Optimization

```cpp
#define TILE_SIZE 16

__global__ void tiled_matmul(
    const float* A, const float* B, float* C,
    int M, int N, int K)  // C[M×N] = A[M×K] * B[K×N]
{
    __shared__ float As[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];
    __shared__ float Bs[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];

    int row = blockIdx.y * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.x;

    float sum = 0.0f;

    // Iterate over tiles of K
    for (int t = 0; t < (K + TILE_SIZE - 1) / TILE_SIZE; t++) {
        // Cooperative load: each thread loads one element
        int a_col = t * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.x;
        int b_row = t * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.y;

        As[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = (row < M && a_col < K) ? A[row * K + a_col] : 0.0f;
        Bs[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = (b_row < K && col < N) ? B[b_row * N + col]  : 0.0f;
        __syncthreads();

        // Compute partial dot product for this tile
        for (int k = 0; k < TILE_SIZE; k++)
            sum += As[threadIdx.y][k] * Bs[k][threadIdx.x];
        __syncthreads();
    }

    if (row < M && col < N)
        C[row * N + col] = sum;
}
```

**Why tiling works:**

```
Naive matmul:
  Each C[i][j] loads K elements from A (row i) and K from B (col j)
  Total global loads: M*N*2K = O(MNK) → memory bound for large K

Tiled matmul with TILE=16:
  Each 16×16 block of C cooperatively loads one 16×16 tile from A and B
  Each load reused 16 times within the tile
  Memory traffic reduced by ~TILE_SIZE = 16×
  Compute:memory ratio increased → compute bound (much faster)
```

## 15. Tensor Cores

Tensor Cores are dedicated matrix-multiply-accumulate units introduced in Volta (CC 7.0). They operate on small matrix tiles in a single instruction.

```cpp
#include <mma.h>
using namespace nvcuda::wmma;

// Tensor Core: 16×16×16 GEMM (FP16 input, FP32 accumulator)
__global__ void tensor_core_matmul(
    const half* A, const half* B, float* C, int M, int N, int K)
{
    fragment<matrix_a, 16, 16, 16, half, row_major> a_frag;
    fragment<matrix_b, 16, 16, 16, half, col_major> b_frag;
    fragment<accumulator, 16, 16, 16, float>         c_frag;

    fill_fragment(c_frag, 0.0f);

    for (int k = 0; k < K; k += 16) {
        load_matrix_sync(a_frag, A + blockIdx.y * 16 * K + k, K);
        load_matrix_sync(b_frag, B + k * N + blockIdx.x * 16, N);
        mma_sync(c_frag, a_frag, b_frag, c_frag);   // D = A*B + C
    }

    store_matrix_sync(C + blockIdx.y * 16 * N + blockIdx.x * 16, c_frag, N, mem_row_major);
}
```

**Tensor Core throughput vs CUDA Cores (H100 SXM, per SM):**

| Precision | CUDA Cores | Tensor Cores |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| FP64 | 67 TFLOPS | 134 TFLOPS |
| TF32 | — | 989 TFLOPS |
| FP16/BF16 | 134 TFLOPS | 1,979 TFLOPS |
| FP8 | — | 3,958 TFLOPS |
| INT8 | 268 TOPS | 3,958 TOPS |

In practice: use `cuBLAS` or `cuDNN` — they use Tensor Cores automatically when shapes are multiples of 16.

## 16. Dynamic Parallelism

Kernels can launch other kernels from the GPU (no CPU round-trip required):

```cpp
__global__ void child_kernel(float* data, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) data[i] *= 2.0f;
}

__global__ void parent_kernel(float* data, int N) {
    // Each block launches its own child kernel
    int chunk = N / gridDim.x;
    int offset = blockIdx.x * chunk;

    child_kernel<<<1, chunk>>>(data + offset, chunk);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();   // wait for children (device-side sync)
}
```

Requires compute capability 3.5+. Adds latency per launch. Best for irregular recursive problems (trees, AMR meshes).

---

## 17. Cooperative Groups

Cooperative groups let you express sync and reduction at any granularity — warp, block, multi-block, or grid.

```cpp
#include <cooperative_groups.h>
namespace cg = cooperative_groups;

__global__ void flexible_reduction(float* data, float* out, int N) {
    auto block = cg::this_thread_block();  // all threads in this block
    auto warp  = cg::tiled_partition<32>(block);  // this warp
    auto tile  = cg::tiled_partition<4>(block);   // group of 4 threads

    float val = data[block.thread_rank()];

    // Warp reduce
    for (int i = warp.size() / 2; i > 0; i >>= 1)
        val += warp.shfl_down(val, i);

    // Write warp result
    if (warp.thread_rank() == 0)
        atomicAdd(out, val);
}

// Grid-wide sync (requires cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel)
__global__ void grid_sync_kernel(float* data) {
    auto grid = cg::this_grid();
    // ... do phase 1 ...
    grid.sync();   // all threads in grid synchronize
    // ... do phase 2 ...
}
```

## 18. Automatic Scalability

CUDA programs scale automatically across different GPU sizes. The same grid runs on a GPU with 4 SMs or 144 SMs — the runtime schedules blocks to available SMs.

![Automatic scalability](../../../Assets/images/automatic-scalability.png)

*The same program scales automatically: 2 SMs run 2 blocks at a time, 4 SMs run 4 blocks at a time. Source: NVIDIA*

This is why you write for **maximum parallelism** and let the hardware decide — don't hardcode grid sizes to a specific GPU.

## 19. Performance Optimization Checklist

### Step 1 — Profile First

```bash
# NVIDIA Nsight Systems (timeline, CPU/GPU overlap)
nsys profile --stats=true ./my_program

# NVIDIA Nsight Compute (kernel-level metrics)
ncu --set full ./my_program
```

### Step 2 — Roofline Analysis

Every kernel is either **compute-bound** or **memory-bound**:

```
Arithmetic Intensity (AI) = FLOPs / bytes accessed
                                                         │ Tensor Core roof (3958 TFLOPS)
Performance (FLOP/s)                                     │
     ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
     ║ memory-bound │               compute-bound        ║
     ║  AI < ridge  │           AI > ridge point         ║
     ╚══════════════╧═══════════════════════════════════╝
                ridge ← Memory BW (3.35 TB/s) / Peak FLOPS

H100 ridge point: ~3,958 TFLOPS / 3,350 GB/s ≈ 1.18 FLOP/byte
```

If your kernel's AI < 1.18 FLOP/byte on H100 → it's memory-bound → focus on coalescing and reuse.

### Step 3 — Common Optimizations

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Low occupancy | Kernel uses many registers | Reduce register pressure; use `__launch_bounds__` |
| Uncoalesced access | High DRAM traffic in Nsight | Restructure to SoA; transpose before processing |
| Bank conflicts | Shared mem replay in Nsight | Pad shared arrays (+1 column) |
| Warp divergence | Low warp execution efficiency | Branchless arithmetic; sort inputs first |
| Too many atomics | High contention | Use per-warp/per-block local accumulators first |
| Launch overhead | Kernel takes < 50 µs but lots of launches | Use CUDA Graphs |
| CPU-GPU idle time | GPU idle in timeline | Async transfers + streams |

### Step 4 — Launch Bounds

```cpp
// Tell the compiler max threads per block and min blocks per SM
// Helps compiler tune register allocation for better occupancy
__launch_bounds__(256, 4)   // max 256 threads/block, at least 4 blocks/SM
__global__ void my_kernel(float* data, int N) { ... }
```
