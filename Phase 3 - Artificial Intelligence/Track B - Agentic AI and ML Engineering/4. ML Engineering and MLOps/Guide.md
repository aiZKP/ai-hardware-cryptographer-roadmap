## Why This Matters for AI Hardware

ML engineers define the **training and serving workloads** that hardware must support:
- Distributed training (data/model/pipeline parallelism) → L3: NCCL, multi-GPU runtime
- Model serving (latency SLAs, throughput targets) → L1a: TensorRT, Triton, vLLM
- Experiment tracking and model versioning → infrastructure that uses GPU clusters (Phase 5A)
- Data pipelines → I/O bandwidth requirements that drive GPUDirect Storage (Phase 5B)

## 1. Training Pipelines

* **Data pipelines:** PyTorch DataLoader, NVIDIA DALI, streaming datasets
* **Distributed training:** DDP (Data Distributed Parallel), FSDP (Fully Sharded), DeepSpeed
* **Mixed precision:** `torch.cuda.amp`, BF16, FP8 training
* **Checkpointing:** model saving, resume from checkpoint, elastic training
* **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optuna, Ray Tune, grid/random/Bayesian search

**Projects:**
1. Train a model with DDP across 2+ GPUs. Measure scaling efficiency.
2. Add mixed precision training. Compare FP32 vs BF16 training speed and accuracy.

## 2. Experiment Tracking & Model Registry

* **Experiment tracking:** MLflow, Weights & Biases (W&B), Neptune
* **Model registry:** versioning, staging, production promotion
* **Dataset versioning:** DVC, LakeFS
* **Reproducibility:** environment tracking, seed management, deterministic training

**Projects:**
1. Set up MLflow tracking for a training run. Log hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts.
2. Register a model in MLflow. Create a staging → production promotion workflow.

## 3. Model Serving & Inference Infrastructure

* **Serving frameworks:** Triton Inference Server, TorchServe, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM
* **Batching:** static batching, dynamic batching, continuous batching (for LLMs)
* **Scaling:** horizontal (replicas), vertical (larger GPU), model parallelism for large models
* **Monitoring:** latency percentiles (p50/p99), throughput (QPS), error rates, GPU utilization
* **A/B testing:** canary deployments, shadow mode, traffic splitting

**Projects:**
1. Deploy a model on Triton with dynamic batching. Load test and measure p50/p99 latency.
2. Deploy an LLM on vLLM. Compare throughput with different batch sizes and quantization levels.

## 4. MLOps & CI/CD for Models

* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for model training, testing, deployment
* **Container orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes, NVIDIA GPU Operator
* **Model testing:** unit tests for preprocessing, integration tests for inference, data drift detection
* **Feature stores:** Feast, Tecton — manage features for training and serving consistency
* **Orchestration:** Kubeflow Pipelines, Apache Airflow, Prefect

**Projects:**
1. Build a CI/CD pipeline: on push → train → evaluate → if improved → deploy to Triton.
2. Set up GPU-enabled Kubernetes with NVIDIA GPU Operator. Deploy a model serving workload.
