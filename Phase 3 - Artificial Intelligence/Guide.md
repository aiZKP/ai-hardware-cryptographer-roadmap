# Phase 3: Artificial Intelligence — The Workloads Your Hardware Must Run

> *Before you design hardware, you must deeply understand the software it accelerates.*

**Layer mapping:** **L1** (Application & Framework) — this entire phase teaches you what AI chips compute.

**Role targets:** ML Inference Engineer · Edge AI Engineer · Agentic AI Engineer · ML Engineer · AI Compiler Engineer

**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (Digital Foundations), Phase 2 (Embedded Systems).

**What comes after:** Phase 4 Track A (FPGA), Track B (Jetson), Track C (ML Compiler).

---

## Why This Phase Exists

Every decision in the 8-layer stack is driven by workload requirements. If you skip this phase, you'll design hardware without knowing what it needs to run. Phase 3 gives you the workload intuition that informs every hardware decision downstream.

## Structure: Core + Two Tracks

**Modules 1–2** are mandatory for everyone. Then you choose **Track A**, **Track B**, or both.

```
Module 1: Neural Networks          ← mandatory (what accelerators compute)
Module 2: Deep Learning Frameworks ← mandatory (micrograd, PyTorch, tinygrad)
        ↓                    ↓
   Track A                Track B

## Track B — Agentic AI & ML Engineering

> *For engineers heading to Phase 5 (HPC, GPU Infrastructure) or building AI applications that generate the inference demand your hardware serves.*

This track teaches the **AI application, infrastructure, and safety workloads** that sit on top of modern inference systems — the demand side of the chip market.

| # | Module | What you learn | Leads to |
|---|--------|---------------|----------|
| **3** | [Agentic AI & GenAI](Track%20B%20-%20Agentic%20AI%20and%20ML%20Engineering/3.%20Agentic%20AI%20and%20GenAI/Guide.md) | LLM agents, RAG pipelines, tool use, multi-step reasoning, prompt-injection basics, coding agents, and GenAI products | Phase 5A/B (GPU Infrastructure, HPC) |

## Relevant Structure: Safe LLM Systems in Track B

For Track B, safety is not a side note. It is part of the application architecture.

- **Module 3B** teaches the threat model: prompt injection, tool misuse, document attacks, and unsafe retrieval context.
- **Module 4B** teaches the operating model: policy gateways, logs, tracing, rollout controls, and production monitoring.
- **Module 5B** teaches the enforcement model: content moderation, jailbreak detection, denied topics, PII redaction, output validation, and fallback behavior.

Use a defense-in-depth pipeline:

```text
User input
  -> Unicode normalization / sanitization
  -> blocklists or denied-topic checks
  -> moderation and jailbreak / prompt-injection classifiers
  -> model with hardened system prompt and tool constraints
  -> output moderation, validation, and PII redaction
  -> logging, review, and threshold tuning
```

The exact policy depends on the product. Some systems block harmful or illegal requests. Others also block application-disallowed topics such as political persuasion, regulated advice, or competitor-sensitive content. The important point is to make policy enforcement explicit and measurable.

## Why Two Tracks?

| | Track A (Hardware & Edge AI) | Track B (Agentic AI & ML Eng) |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Understand workloads that run on your chip | Understand workloads that create inference demand |
| **Focus** | Perception, sensors, optimization, deployment | LLMs, agents, training pipelines, serving |
| **Hardware connection** | Direct — you deploy on FPGA/Jetson/NPU | Indirect — you generate the traffic the chip serves |
| **Job market** | L1a, L1b, L1c roles (~4,500/month) | L1d, L1e roles (~15,000/month) |
| **Remote %** | 10–15% (hardware access needed) | 20–25% (cloud/API-based) |
| **Phase 4 path** | Track A → B → C (all hardware) | Track C (compiler) or Phase 5 directly |

**Do both?** If you have time, Track A → Track B gives you full L1 coverage. Most hardware-focused engineers do Track A first, then add Track B topics as needed.

## How This Phase Connects to the Stack

| What you learn | How it informs hardware design |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Matrix multiply in neural networks | L5: systolic array dimensions, dataflow strategy |
| Conv2D, attention, pooling ops | L2: what the compiler must fuse and tile |
| Quantization (INT8, FP8) | L6: precision support in PE design |
| LLM inference (KV-cache, batching) | L5: memory hierarchy, HBM bandwidth requirements |
| Model computational graphs | L2: graph IR representation, fusion opportunities |
| Training at scale (distributed) | L3: NCCL, multi-GPU runtime |
| Moderation, guardrails, and prompt shielding | L3/L4: serving topology, latency budget, sidecar services, and policy gateways |

---

## What You Should Produce

By the end of this phase, you should have at least:

- one model-implementation or workload-intuition artifact from the core modules
- one deployment- or optimization-oriented artifact from Track A or Track B
- one short write-up connecting workload behavior to hardware constraints such as memory, latency, throughput, or precision

Examples include a quantization comparison, a profiling note, a tinygrad trace, a RAG latency analysis, or a sensor-pipeline benchmark.

---

## Exit Criteria

You are ready for Phase 4 when you can:

- explain what your target workloads actually compute
- identify whether a workload is dominated by compute, memory, batching, context length, or deployment constraints
- connect model structure to compiler, runtime, or hardware implications
- show at least one artifact that proves you did more than read about the workload
