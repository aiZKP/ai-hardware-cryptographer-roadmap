# AGNOS: Learn with the Operating System Course

**Goal:** Use the [Operating Systems](../../../Phase%201%20-%20Foundational%20Knowledge/4.%20Operating%20Systems/Guide.md) course (Phase 1) to understand AGNOS—the **forked and custom-modified Linux** that runs **openpilot on the road** on comma 3X and comma four. The lectures map to both where code lives and to the **development changes** comma made in the fork for this practical use case.

## What AGNOS Is: Forked Linux + Custom Development for openpilot on the Road

AGNOS is **not** a generic Linux distro. It is:

1. **A fork of the Linux kernel** — [agnos-kernel-sdm845](https://github.com/commaai/agnos-kernel-sdm845) is based on the Linux kernel (Android/common baseline for SDM845), then **custom modified and developed** by comma for their hardware and for openpilot.
2. **A custom-built OS image** — [agnos-builder](https://github.com/commaai/agnos-builder) produces the full stack: that kernel, boot chain (XBL, ABL, etc.), device tree, initramfs, and Ubuntu-based userspace.
3. **Built for one practical use case** — **running openpilot in the car, on the road.** Camera pipelines, CAN bus, real-time control loops, and inference all depend on this OS. The development changes in the fork (driver patches, device tree, boot config, scheduler behavior) are there so that openpilot can meet latency and reliability requirements in production.

So when you study the OS lectures and then look at AGNOS, you are looking at **how a real team forked Linux and changed it** to support a specific product (openpilot on comma devices). The table below ties each lecture to both **where** that topic appears in the tree and **what kind of development change** in AGNOS relates to it.

## OS Lectures ↔ AGNOS Development Changes (Fork + Custom Mods for openpilot)

The kernel in AGNOS is **forked from Linux and custom modified**. The table below connects each OS lecture to the **kind of development change** comma made in that fork for the **on-the-road openpilot** use case. Use it to see why each OS topic matters in practice.

| # | Lecture topic | Development change in AGNOS (fork / custom work) | Why it matters for openpilot on the road |
|:-:|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 | OS architecture, monolithic kernel | Fork keeps Linux monolithic layout; **platform-specific code** in `arch/arm64/` and **vendor drivers** (camera ISP, CAN, GPU) added or patched for SDM845 and comma 3X hardware. | One kernel image drives cameras, CAN, and GPU; no extra IPC cost. Upstream changes could break ABI — comma **pins the kernel** to keep V4L2/ISP and SocketCAN stable for camerad and controlsd. |
| 2 | Processes, task_struct, fork/exec | Kernel process model unchanged; **agnos-builder** defines **which processes run** (systemd, openpilot’s camerad, modeld, controlsd) and how they are started. | openpilot’s multi-process design (camerad → modeld → plannerd → controlsd) relies on this; crash isolation and COW fork come from the same process model. |
| 3 | Interrupts, exceptions, bottom halves | **Driver changes**: camera and CAN drivers register IRQs and bottom-half paths; **latency of these paths** directly affects frame capture and CAN write timing. Comma’s patches keep interrupt and softirq handling predictable. | High-framerate camera and 100 Hz CAN need bounded interrupt latency; `/proc/interrupts` and IRQ affinity matter for tuning. |
| 4 | System calls, vDSO | Syscall and vDSO code is largely upstream; **no major fork-specific change**. vDSO `clock_gettime` is used by openpilot for sensor and model timestamps. | Stable, low-overhead timestamps for fusion and logging without syscall cost. |
| 5 | Boot, Device Tree, kernel modules | **Heavy development**: (1) **Boot chain** — agnos-builder supplies firmware (XBL, ABL), kernel, DTB, initrd; (2) **Device Tree** — DTS for comma 3X/four (cameras, SPI, CAN, GPIO); (3) **Driver probe** — camera ISP, CAN-over-SPI, power management drivers added/patched and matched via `compatible` in DT. | Correct boot and DT are required for cameras and CAN to appear; wrong DT or missing driver = no openpilot on the road. |
| 6 | CPU scheduling (CFS, SCHED_FIFO) | **Config and usage**: kernel has CFS/RT classes; **boot cmdline** (e.g. isolcpus) and **openpilot** use of `set_realtime_priority()` and `set_core_affinity()` (in openpilot repo). Comma may tune default scheduler or cmdline for RT workloads. | controlsd and modeld must hit deadlines; SCHED_FIFO and affinity avoid CFS jitter that would cause missed CAN frames or dropped frames. |
| 7 | Real-time (PREEMPT_RT, determinism) | **Kernel config**: preemption and locking options chosen for low latency; PREEMPT_RT or related patches may be applied in the fork for deterministic response. | controlsd CAN writes and inference loops need bounded latency; RT config is part of “openpilot on the road” reliability. |
| 8 | Multi-core, affinity, isolcpus | **Boot and userspace**: **agnos-builder** or device config sets **isolcpus** (and related cmdline); openpilot **set_core_affinity()** pins camerad/modeld/controlsd to chosen cores. Fork may carry scheduler/affinity fixes. | Isolating cores and pinning RT processes avoids interference from other work and reduces tail latency. |
| 9 | Synchronization (spinlocks, mutexes) | **Driver and core code**: any **new or modified driver** (camera, CAN, SPI) uses kernel locking primitives; lock design in the fork affects contention and latency. | Bad locking in a driver can cause stalls or priority inversion; PI mutex (Lecture 11) is relevant for openpilot’s high-priority control vs lower-priority readers. |
| 10 | RCU, lock-free, atomics | **Core kernel** uses RCU and atomics; fork may backport or tune for SDM845. No openpilot-specific RCU change, but **rcu_nocbs** on isolated cores (cmdline) moves RCU off RT cores. | Less jitter on cores running control and inference. |
| 11 | Deadlock, priority inversion, PI mutex | **Kernel** has rtmutex and PI; **openpilot** has high- and low-priority processes sharing state (e.g. cereal). Fork keeps PI mutex support so high-priority control is not blocked by low-priority readers. | Avoids “Mars Pathfinder”–style priority inversion in production. |
| 12 | Virtual memory, COW | **Core mm/** and **arch/arm64/mm**; fork keeps standard VM and COW. **openpilot** benefits: process isolation and COW fork for modeld/camerad without doubling RAM. | Stable VM model for multi-process openpilot and large model mappings. |
| 13–14 | Page tables, TLBs, SLUB, CMA | **mm/** and **arch/arm64/mm**; **CMA** is important for **camera and DMA buffers** on embedded SoCs — fork may enable or tune CMA for SDM845. | Camera pipeline and zero-copy buffers depend on contiguous and slab allocation. |
| 15 | DMA, IOMMU, GPU memory | **Driver and SoC support**: DMA and GPU (Adreno) drivers in the fork; IOMMU if enabled. **Buffer sharing** (camera ↔ GPU ↔ display) is platform-specific. | Needed for camera → GPU inference and display without extra copies. |
| 16 | NUMA | SDM845 is UMA; **little fork-specific NUMA work**. Affinity (Lecture 8) matters more than NUMA here. | — |
| 17 | Device driver model, Device Tree | **Central to the fork**: **new DTS files** and **of_match_table** in drivers for comma 3X/four; platform and bus code tie DT to driver probe. | Every comma-specific device (camera, CAN-over-SPI, etc.) is brought up via this model. |
| 18 | Character drivers, V4L2 | **Major development**: **camera ISP and V4L2** drivers are added or heavily patched for **road-facing and driver-monitoring cameras** on comma hardware. Register maps and subdevice layout are device-specific. | camerad depends on V4L2; “pins its kernel to maintain camera ISP register map compatibility” (Lecture-01) — these are the drivers that get pinned. |
| 19 | io_uring, DMA-BUF, zero-copy | **DMA-BUF and zero-copy** in kernel; **openpilot VisionIpc** uses shared memory and DMA-BUF-style sharing on top. Fork may enable or patch DMA-BUF for camera/GPU. | Low-latency, zero-copy path from camera to modeld and encoder. |
| 20 | PCIe, NVMe, GPU | **GPU (Adreno)** and storage (UFS) drivers in the fork for SDM845; PCIe/NVMe if present on carrier. | GPU runs inference; storage holds OS and logs. |
| 21 | Filesystems (ext4, overlayfs) | **agnos-builder** chooses rootfs layout (ext4 or similar) and overlay for updates; kernel has matching fs support. | Read-only root + writable overlay is common for reliable in-field updates. |
| 22 | eMMC/UFS, OTA partitioning | **agnos-builder** defines **partition layout and A/B slots**; kernel block and UFS drivers support the device. **OTA** flow (e.g. updateinstallerd) relies on this. | Safe, resettable updates for openpilot in the field without bricking the device. |
| 23 | cgroups | **Optional** in AGNOS userspace for isolation or resource limits; kernel cgroup support is standard. | Can limit non-critical services so they don’t starve openpilot. |
| 24 | OS for AI (L4T vs openpilot OS, RT tuning) | **AGNOS = “openpilot OS”** — the **entire fork and builder** are this. All previous rows (boot, DT, drivers, scheduler, memory, storage) are the “development changes” for AI/RT on the road. L4T is the Jetson counterpart; Agnos is the comma counterpart. | Direct mapping: this lecture describes why Agnos exists and how it’s tuned for openpilot. |
| 25 | Capstone (custom Linux image) | **agnos-builder** is the **custom image build** for comma devices (not Yocto, but same idea): reproducible kernel + rootfs + boot artifacts. | Delivers the single “AGNOS” image that goes on the device and runs openpilot. |
| 26 | eBPF observability | **Kernel** may enable CONFIG_BPF; **observability** of openpilot (camerad, modeld, controlsd) with bpftrace/perf runs on this kernel. | Debugging and profiling openpilot in development and in the field. |

| **Device Tree** (`.dts`/`.dtb`, `compatible`, driver probe) | **agnos-kernel-sdm845:** `arch/arm64/boot/dts/`, `*.dts` / `*.dtsi`. Search for `compatible` and driver `of_match_table` in `drivers/`. |
| **Kernel command line** (`isolcpus`, `nohz_full`, `rcu_nocbs`) | **agnos-builder:** Boot config; **agnos-kernel-sdm845:** `kernel/sched/` consumes cmdline for isolcpus etc. |
| **initramfs** | **agnos-builder:** `build_system.sh` and `userspace/` pack early rootfs; inspect for init and switch_root. |
| **Kernel modules** | **agnos-kernel-sdm845:** `drivers/`, `Kconfig`, `Makefile`; builder builds kernel (and modules) as part of AGNOS image. |

**Tasks:** `grep -r "compatible" agnos-kernel-sdm845/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ | head -30`; trace artifacts in `agnos-builder/build_kernel.sh` and `build_system.sh`.

## Suggested Study Path

1. **Phase 1 — OS course (all 26 lectures)**  
   Use the [All OS Lectures → AGNOS (Overview)](#all-os-lectures--agnos-overview) table above: every lecture links to the OS slide and to concrete kernel/builder paths. Start with Lectures 1–6 (architecture, processes, interrupts, syscalls, boot/DT, scheduling), then follow the rest in order or by topic.

2. **Clone and open the two repos**  
   Keep [Phase 1 — Operating Systems — Guide](../../../Phase%201%20-%20Foundational%20Knowledge/4.%20Operating%20Systems/Guide.md) and lecture list handy.

3. **agnos-kernel-sdm845**  
   - Browse `arch/arm64/`, `kernel/sched/`, `drivers/`.  
   - Search for `compatible`, `of_match_table`, `probe`, `module_init` to see Device Tree and module flow (Lecture 5).  
   - Look at `kernel/sched/fair.c` and `rt.c` for CFS and RT (Lecture 6).

4. **agnos-builder**  
   - Read `README.md`, run (if you have Docker) `./build_kernel.sh` and/or `./build_system.sh`.  
   - Trace boot artifacts: kernel image, DTB, initrd, rootfs in scripts and `firmware/`.

5. **Cross-link with openpilot**  
   openpilot runs on AGNOS. [Lecture-05](../../../Phase%201%20-%20Foundational%20Knowledge/4.%20Operating%20Systems/Lectures/Lecture-05.md) and [Lecture-06](../../../Phase%201%20-%20Foundational%20Knowledge/4.%20Operating%20Systems/Lectures/Lecture-06.md) “Real example in openpilot” sections point to `openpilot/common/util.cc` (`set_realtime_priority`, `set_core_affinity`) — those system calls target the AGNOS kernel.
