**5. AI Chip Design (18-36 months)**

**Prerequisite: Master AI/Software Stack First**

* **Why Software First:**
    * **Hardware-Software Co-Design:** AI chip design requires deep understanding of the software stack—training frameworks, inference runtimes, and operator semantics. Design hardware that software actually needs.
    * **Workload Characterization:** Profile real AI workloads (training, inference) to identify bottlenecks. Understand memory bandwidth, compute intensity, and data reuse patterns before designing hardware.
    * **Reference: tinygrad:** Study tinygrad—a minimal, readable deep learning framework. It exposes the essence of tensor operations, autograd, and code generation. Understanding tinygrad helps you see what hardware must accelerate.

* **tinygrad and Minimal ML Frameworks:**
    * **tinygrad Architecture:** Study tinygrad's lazy evaluation, linearized IR (intermediate representation), and code generation for different backends (CPU, GPU, custom).
    * **Operator Semantics:** Understand how tinygrad implements conv2d, matmul, attention, and other ops. Trace the graph and memory access patterns.
    * **Extending tinygrad:** Add a custom backend or new op. This teaches you the interface between software and hardware.
    * **Other Minimal Frameworks:** Explore mlx, JAX (for understanding tracing and compilation), or Triton (for GPU kernel design).

**Resources:**

* **tinygrad GitHub:** https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad — Minimal and readable. Study the codebase.
* **"Tinygrad: A Simple Autograd Engine" (blog/videos):** George Hotz's explanations of tinygrad design.
* **"Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach" (Hennessy & Patterson):** Foundation for understanding accelerator design.

**Projects:**

* **Implement a Custom tinygrad Backend:** Target a simple accelerator (e.g., FPGA, custom simulator) from tinygrad.
* **Profile and Optimize a Model in tinygrad:** Identify compute-bound vs. memory-bound layers. Propose hardware optimizations.


**2. AI Accelerator Architecture**

* **Compute and Memory:**
    * **Systolic Arrays and TPUs:** Understand systolic array architecture for matrix multiplication. Study Google TPU and similar designs.
    * **Dataflow Architectures:** Learn dataflow (e.g., Eyeriss, NVDLA) vs. control-flow architectures. Understand spatial vs. temporal compute.
    * **Memory Hierarchy:** Design for memory bandwidth—on-chip SRAM, HBM, and data reuse. Roofline model for accelerators.

* **Quantization and Precision:**
    * **INT8/INT4 Inference:** Quantization-aware design for low-precision compute. Understand the trade-offs for different precisions.
    * **Mixed-Precision Training:** FP16/BF16 for training. Study gradient scaling and loss scaling.

* **Compiler and Runtime:**
    * **TVM and MLIR:** Study TVM for compiling high-level models to hardware. Understand MLIR dialects for AI accelerators.
    * **Kernel Fusion and Scheduling:** Learn how compilers fuse ops and schedule kernels for optimal performance.

**Resources:**

* **"Eyeriss: A Spatial Architecture for Energy-Efficient Dataflow for CNN" (paper):** Classic accelerator architecture.
* **"A Full-Stack Accelerator for Deep Learning" (NVDLA):** Open-source Nvidia design.
* **TVM and Apache TVM:** Compiler stack for deep learning.

**Projects:**

* **Design a Simple Matrix Multiply Accelerator:** Specify the architecture (e.g., systolic array) for a small accelerator in RTL or high-level synthesis.
* **Map a tinygrad Model to Your Accelerator:** Define the mapping from tinygrad ops to your hardware.


**3. From Software to Silicon**

* **RTL and Verification:**
    * **Verilog/SystemVerilog for Accelerators:** Implement key datapath and control blocks for an AI accelerator.
    * **High-Level Synthesis (HLS):** Use HLS (Vitis HLS, etc.) to accelerate design for matrix ops and custom kernels.
    * **Formal Verification:** Apply formal methods for critical datapath correctness.

* **FPGA Prototyping:**
    * **FPGA as Accelerator:** Deploy a small AI accelerator on FPGA. Use frameworks like FINN (Xilinx) for quantized neural networks.
    * **Co-Design with CPUs/GPUs:** Integrate FPGA accelerators with host systems. Understand PCIe, DMA, and driver interfaces.

* **ASIC and Tape-Out (Advanced):**
    * **Physical Design:** Overview of place-and-route, timing closure, and power analysis for AI chips.
    * **Industry and Startups:** Study commercial AI chips (Nvidia, AMD, Cerebras, Groq, etc.) and startup approaches.

**Resources:**

* **FINN (Xilinx):** Framework for building fast, flexible FPGA accelerators for neural networks.
* **NVDLA (Nvidia):** Open-source deep learning accelerator.
* **Chip design courses (e.g., Berkeley, Stanford):** Online courses on digital design and computer architecture.

**Projects:**

* **Implement a Small Accelerator on FPGA:** Build a matrix multiply or conv2d accelerator using HLS or RTL.
* **Compare tinygrad on CPU vs. Your FPGA Accelerator:** Benchmark and analyze the speedup and efficiency.
