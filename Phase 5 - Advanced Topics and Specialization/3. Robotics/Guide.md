**3. Robotics (12-18 months)**

This phase is organized into **four lecture tracks** (each has its own folder and `Lecture-01.md`). Start with **Advanced Robot Operating System**, then proceed in order or jump by topic.

| # | Track | Folder / lecture |
|---|--------|------------------|
| 1 | **Advanced Robot Operating System** (ROS / ROS 2, Nav2, SLAM, MoveIt 2) | [Advanced Robot Operating System/Lecture-01.md](Advanced%20Robot%20Operating%20System/Lecture-01.md) |
| 2 | **Industrial and Embedded Robotics** (ROS-I, embedded, Docker, Gazebo / Isaac Sim) | [Industrial and Embedded Robotics/Lecture-01.md](Industrial%20and%20Embedded%20Robotics/Lecture-01.md) |
| 3 | **Advanced Perception and AI for Robotics** (applied ROS 2 perception loop, deep learning perception, robot learning) | [Advanced Perception and AI for Robotics/Lecture-01.md](Advanced%20Perception%20and%20AI%20for%20Robotics/Lecture-01.md) |
| 4 | **Multi-Robot Systems and Swarm Robotics** | [Multi-Robot Systems and Swarm Robotics/Lecture-01.md](Multi-Robot%20Systems%20and%20Swarm%20Robotics/Lecture-01.md) |

Each `Lecture-01.md` is a **full lecture**: learning objectives, worked conceptual sections, tables/diagrams where helpful, **self-check** questions, and links to the next/previous track.

**Extended timeline (18-36 months):** Lectures 3–4 include the **expanded** topics that were previously labeled “Phase 2 (Significantly Expanded)” in older versions of this file (deep perception, robot learning, multi-robot / swarm). All of that material now lives in **Lecture-01.md** for tracks 3 and 4.

**Recommended courses (online)**

Use these **structured courses** alongside each lecture’s **Recommended courses** section. Official ROS 2 and vendor docs stay the source of truth; courses help when you want guided projects, browser-based simulators (e.g. The Construct), or university-style theory. Full catalog (The Construct): [Robotics & ROS courses](https://www.theconstruct.ai/robotigniteacademy_learnros/ros-courses-library/).
